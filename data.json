Research affirms the importance of second language education regarding intellectual potential, scholastic achievement, first language skills, citizenship and the economy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Learning a second language in this context is not learning a second language as a natural process when one acquires a first language. After childhood, the areas of the brain that are responsible for language acquisition become more fixed, and the process of picking up additional languages becomes more academic and less organic. The specific context concerns a person who has learned his or her first language automatically and is now learning a new language through a teacher, self-teaching or teaching oneself with a book or maybe online.<br></div><div><br></div><div>School children can get unexpected benefits from learning a foreign language. Educational research shows that results in English and Science are better for students who study one. The reasons for this are not altogether clear: perhaps the study skills acquired and used for studying another language also strengthen study skills used in other areas and it could also strengthen the ability to analyse and interpret information. It also seems that knowledge of the grammar of students&#8217; native language is often made clearer to them through explicitly learning another language&#8217;s grammar. A foreign language is a whole new system with distinct rules, etymology, and meaning, which are just a few of the complexities of a language. Learning a new one puts the brain to task by recognising this new language structure. As the brain works out meaning and makes full use of this new arsenal to express ideas, it seems that it sharpens skills on reading, negotiating, and problem-solving.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Multi-tasking is stressful to those who are not skilled at it. People who are multilingual are proficient at slipping from one language system to another and using totally different language mechanics. This is very distracting and demanding work, not only for the tongue and language faculties, but also especially for the brain. People who have developed multilingual ability are highly proficient multi-taskers and commit very few errors when juggling various activities.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Related to this, with other factors held constant, several pieces of research have also shown that multilingual adults experienced the onset of Alzheimer&#8217;s and dementia at a later age of 75 compared to monolingual adults, who had the first signs at age 71. The studies were conducted with other variables such as gender, overall health, educational level, and economic status, but there were no significant results that contributed to the mentioned diseases as significantly as the number of languages spoken. It seems that the more the brain is used, the better its functions work. Learning a new language structure entails familiarising with vocabulary and rules, and converting this memorised information into communication. This strengthens memory, because the brain has built its ability to associate information with mnemonics in order to retain information better. Hence, multilingual people have brains that are more exercised and quicker to recall.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since a language is a doorway to a particular culture, learning a new language enables a person to have a broader understanding of the race or culture that speaks it. Opening up to a culture allows people to be more flexible and appreciative of other ways of doing and looking at things. As a result, if people are multilingual, they have the advantage of seeing the world from different vantage points. In today&#8217;s interconnectedness, this is a valuable tool and with universal unemployment problems, a multilingual ability is definitely a competitive edge over others. Businesses are of course interested in people who have an ability that improves their intelligence, flexibility, openness to diverse people, and decision-making skills. And these are just bonuses to the evident ability to communicate in several languages and cross-cultural barriers. Additionally, speaking another language can simply give people a lot of pleasure, as they can communicate with others in their native language.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Finally, self-confidence is a normal consequence of learning a new language. By simply mastering one skill, the other faculties are developed. No matter their background, people tend to gravitate around multilingual people because of their skills; others simply find the openness and quick- mindedness of multi-lingual people naturally attractive. It is an interesting outcome, not at all something that is expected as a result when people embark to learn a new language, but trying to understand a language and the heritage that goes with it will put the learner in a position of self- discovery. It makes learners come to terms with how they view the world and other cultures, and have more appreciation of their own.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The cognitive and neurological benefits of learning a foreign language extend from early childhood to old age, as the brain more efficiently processes information and staves off cognitive decline. These cognitive and neurological benefits are instantly apparent, but there occurs a host of social, cultural and personal benefits, among them the ability to explore a culture through its native tongue or talk to someone with whom it might otherwise not be able to communicate. Learning a second language is best introduced at the earliest age possible, but learning it at a much later age is still very much worthwhile.<br></div></div>",

Lying off the east coast of Australia, it covers an area larger than 300,000 square kilometres and is a unique habitat hosting billions of sea creatures. It also is a major source of income to people near the Reef, with tourism now being the key industry in the local towns.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Not all is well with the Great Barrier Reef; there are growing threats, the most serious being climate change. Organisations are working hard to impress upon the world&#8217;s governments the need for urgent action to address climate change globally. To help boost the Reef&#8217;s resilience to climate change, efforts are also being made to take action on the local effects of coastal development, such as from ports and agriculture.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Climate change threatens the Great Barrier Reef in different ways. Firstly, it can increase severe weather events, such as repeated cyclones and flooding. Cyclones can have devastating effects on the Great Barrier Reef, the immediate effect being the physical damage. Fast maturing coral is easily destroyed by storms, while slow maturing, more solid coral generally is spared. All coral though can be affected by the flooding caused by cyclones. Flooding on land can lead to large flood plumes from rivers being expelled into the sea that supports the Great Barrier Reef. Freshwater flood plumes can have a number of effects, including killing coral at shallow depths. Large scale flooding can carry various land-based pollutants, such as fertilisers, herbicides and the worst, pesticides, out to the Reef, which can have a devastating effect. A lesser-known problem is that earth or residue that is carried out to sea can affect coral growing in the deep water, as it can block out the light that coral needs to survive. In some locations, approximately 10 per cent of corals have bleached in shallow waters, indicating that the run-off is causing stress to reefs. Australian scientists have also observed sunken logs and terrestrial debris breaking up fragile corals in wave-exposed sections of the reefs. Although flood plumes are natural events, scientists predict that climate change worsens their impact. Expected increases in cyclone intensity will increase the size and frequency of flood events and thus the quantity of land-based runoff and pollutants making it to the Reef.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the long-term, ocean acidification is likely to be the most significant impact of a changing climate on the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. The oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and are estimated to have absorbed about half the excess carbon dioxide released by human activities in the past 200 years. This absorbed carbon dioxide is resulting in chemical&#160;changes in the ocean, which is referred to as ocean acidification. Although the chemistry is simple and well understood, its effect on marine life is much less well known, as the process has only been recognised for around a decade. Even relatively small increases in ocean acidity decrease the capacity of corals to build skeletons, which in turn decreases their capacity to create living environments for the Reef&#8217;s marine life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Climate change is also causing increases in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric temperatures. A lack of cloud cover and also freshwater run-off can all contribute to this. Temperature is a key environmental factor controlling the distribution and diversity of marine life; it is critical to reef building and controls the rate of coral reef growth more than anything. All animals and plants have temperature limits and when these are exceeded, natural processes break down. On coral reefs, surface temperature changes affect the relationship of mutual dependence between some animals and the algae that live within their tissues. The temperature gradient along the Great Barrier Reef has shifted markedly over the last century and is likely to continue to rise over the present century. Whatever climate scenario is used, it is predicted that by 2035, the average sea surface temperature will be warmer than any previously recorded.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Rising sea levels are another significant danger, because much of the Great Barrier Reef coastline is low-lying. Predictions of a future increase in sea levels are highly variable, but large changes in sea levels can mean land inundation, which will cause significant changes in tidal habitats, such as saltwater intrusion into low-lying freshwater habitats like mangroves. Sea levels on the Great Barrier Reef have already risen by approximately three millimetres per year since 1991, due to a combination of thermal expansion in the oceans and, most significantly, glaciers melting. Changes in sea levels from temperature increases are time-dependent and uncertain, because they are partly linked to the collapse of the Earth&#8217;s great ice shelves. Reefs will probably be able to accommodate a sea level rise of three millimetres, however, as the rate of sea level rise increases, the Reef&#8217;s coral will be more and more affected.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It seems that local people are motivated to change in order to protect the Great Barrier Reef, however, the worst threats to the Reef are because of climate change issues. As long as this continues, the Great Barrier Reef will continue to be in danger and with many countries in the world refusing to take action that might threaten their economies, it does not really matter how behaviours are changed in Australia.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Glossary</div><div><br></div><div>Flood plume&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A body of water that spreads out in a feather shape</div><div><br></div><div>Inundation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Flooding</div></div>",

        "content": "<b>READING PASSAGE 3</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>The Power of Music</b><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>Of the estimated sixty billion broadcast advertising hours encountered by North Americans each year, approximately three-quarters employ music in some manner.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since the Ancient Greeks, music has been recognised as a powerful emotional force. They believed that music was such a powerful force that it could stir men into bravery on the battlefields or it could impose moral order and civilising harmony on unruly pupils. The rhythms and melodies of music can help words to stick in the brain much more effectively than if those words were delivered as speech alone, and music can also convey a particular mood.<br></div><div><br></div><div>By the twentieth century, music&#8217;s emotional force was irresistible to advertisers, who wanted to influence their audiences into buying their products. Mass advertising using soundtracks began in the 1920&#8217;s and 1930&#8217;s with commercial radio in the United States, and, by the 1950&#8217;s, most radio advertisements included an advertising jingle, which would help promote the products.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music has also been central to television advertising since the 1950&#8217;s, particularly because music can convey an emotional or subliminal message. A recently-published book describes how music was used in a TV commercial to sell Ford cars in 1959. Ford wanted to sell a particular car as an economy model, and they wanted to point out to potential buyers that it would actually save them lots of money on miles per gallon and other money-saving features. However, they worried that this might make the vehicle be perceived as low quality. To avoid this, the advertisers accompanied the advertisement with a soundtrack using lush string music, not usually associated with low price items, and the sales rocketed. The advert was judged a massive success because of the high quality subliminal message given by the music.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music can serve the overall promotional goals in one or more of several capacities. Good music can contribute to the effectiveness of an advertisement merely by making it more attractive. A good advertisement engages the attention of an audience, and the most straightforward way of achieving this is to make it entertaining. Music serves to engage listeners&#8217; attention and render the advertisement less of an unwanted intrusion.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music may also be employed in various structural roles. Perhaps the most important structural role is in tying together a sequence of visual images and/or a series of dramatic episodes, narrative voice-overs, or a list of product appeals. Historically originating in film music, advertising&#160;music can also be structurally employed as simply an uninterrupted background, or to heighten or highlight dramatic moments.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A third important function for music is to intensify the familiarity of a product. Consumers are known to favour products that elicit some degree of memory, even if it is merely the product&#8217;s name. It is one of the peculiarities of human audition and cognition that music tends to linger in the listener&#8217;s mind. Surprisingly, such musical lingering may occur even when the mind is an unwilling host. Thus, the association of music with the identity of a certain product may substantially aid product recall.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A fourth technique of musical enhancement is the use of lyrical language. Vocal music permits the conveyance of a verbal communication in a non-spoken way. Language utterances can sound much less naive or self-indulgent when couched within a musical phrase rather than being simply spoken. An individual can respectably sing things that would sound utterly trite if said.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Last is the use of music to enhance an advertisement&#8217;s credibility and authority. Indeed, it may be the case that effective targeting is merely the result of the formation of proper authority. A simple way of creating this is through specialist testimony or employing celebrities. However, over periods of time, consumers become resistant to the means by which advertisers establish authority. One sophisticated way of getting round this is through music. Musical authority can be established most readily through quotation, allusion, or plagiarism.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The role of music in advertising recognises that music is a really powerful tool for selling things and this success has created added responsibilities to those people who wish to become music composers. From the middle of the twentieth century, composers have increasingly had to face extreme constraints if they have written music for films or TV or other media. In the 1930&#8217;s, the rise of films with soundtracks led to a new type of commission for composers, where they had to tailor their music to a film scenario, to its narrative pace, and to the emotions of a character. They had to write music that was of a precise length, down to the nearest second, and more recently, film and TV composers have written so-called library music, where their soundtrack is categorised by describing its emotional evocation, and can be used in a variety of programmes. Viewers may have had the experience of watching a television programme and thinking, &#8220;I actually recognise that music from a previous series or a completely different programme.&#8221; This is because the programme is using this so-called library music, where a composer has written music that is supposed to represent joy or the sun rising, and that music will then be reused whenever the producer of a film or a TV programme enters those particular emotional keywords into the database of library music.<br></div><div><br></div><div>However one measures good music, it must be acknowledged that, on a second-for-second basis, music created for the media, and especially for advertising, is perhaps the most meticulously crafted music in history. Nationally produced television advertisements in particular may be considered among the most highly polished cultural artifacts ever created. Whether this is ethical or not is an altogether different question.<br></div></div>",

        "content": "&#160; &#160; &#160;When people consider today how indispensable the Internet is, they often overlook that without electricity, it would not function. Living without the Internet would be a significant inconvenience today, but without electricity, life as we know now it would collapse. Since we started using electricity, which was in the middle of the nineteenth century, we have worked on ways to move and store it easily and efficiently and one of the most common ways of storing electricity has been the battery. A battery does not actually store electricity. A battery, which is actually an electric cell, is a device that produces electricity from a chemical reaction. The story of the battery is one of people trying to create different compounds to create an electric current. The two goals on improving batteries have always been to create ones that can produce an electric current for a long time and to make them smaller and smaller. <br>&#160; &#160; &#160; Alessandro Volta is credited with creating in 1800 the first battery and the first practical method of generating electricity. Luigi Galvani, another Italian scientist and contemporary of Volta, almost made the discovery, but misinterpreted his research results. Using a frog&#8217;s leg in an experiment, Galvani concluded that the electric current was &#8216;animal electricity&#8217; and did not come from the apparatus he had set up. Volta&#8217;s battery was made by piling up layers of silver and paper or cloth, soaked in salt, and zinc. These layers were assembled, without paper or cloth between the zinc and silver, until the current was created.<br><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;Volta&#8217;s battery was not good for delivering currents for any significant duration. This restriction&#10;was overcome in the Daniell Cell in 1820. Using different chemicals, John Daniell used a copper&#10;pot, copper sulphate, sulphuric acid and mercury to produce his electric current.&#160;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;Although we now&#10;know better than to put mercury into batteries, this battery, which produced about 1.1 volts, was&#10;used to power telegraphs, telephones, and even to ring doorbells in homes for over 100 years.&#10;Although many other chemical combinations were used in batteries over the years, the lead acid&#10;battery is one that stands out. First made in 1859, it was further improved in 1881 and this design&#10;even now forms the basis of the modern lead acid battery found in cars.</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;One very common battery used today is the lithium-ion battery, which was developed by the&#10;United States&#8217; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a part of their efforts during the Cold War. The&#10;idea surrounding the lithium-ion battery was to create a power source that could provide a longduration, high-density energy supply in a small package. In the early 1960&#8217;s, both the private and&#10;public sectors were experimenting with creating batteries using lithium, but the breakthrough in&#10;the chemistry was achieved by adding the ion into the equation. Not long after its invention, the&#10;CIA shared the lithium-ion battery concept with the public and a company working on an&#10;exploratory project developed and created the first patent for the lithium-ion battery for&#10;commercial use in 1968. Used for a variety of different applications, the first lithium-ion battery&#10;was a game-changer in the medical industry, where it is used as the power source in heart&#10;pacemakers.&#160;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160; Today, the lithium-ion battery is the most common type of battery used in pacemakers, because&#10;of its reliability and life span. Most lithium-ion batteries can last 10 years or longer in a cardiac&#10;pacemaker. What makes lithium-ion batteries even more valuable in cardiac pacemakers is that,&#10;when the battery nears the end of its life, the voltage begins to decrease. Because of the battery&#8217;s&#10;decreasing voltage, electrical designers can design an indicator for the pacemaker that allows the&#10;device to inform the doctor a new battery is needed. The battery can then be changed safely&#10;before it completely discharges. Lithium-ion batteries can also be used for other medical&#10;applications, including neurostimulation and insulin pumps for diabetics.</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;Whilst people consider the mid-nineteenth century to have been when civilisation started using&#10;electricity, there has been a discovery of what could be a battery that seems to indicate that&#10;electricity was used long ago. What has become known as the Parthian Battery was found on a&#10;railway construction site in 1936. Dating back 2,000 years, the &#8216;battery&#8217; would have comprised a&#10;clay jar filled with a vinegar solution. An iron rod was put into the middle of the jar and encircled&#10;with copper wire. Tests have shown that this &#8216;battery&#8217; could produce 2 volts of electricity. It would&#10;have not been used for electricity as we generally use it today, but it has been theorised it could&#10;have been used for electroplating objects with metals, such as gold or silver. Most scientists reject&#10;these theories nowadays and hypothesise that the &#8216;battery&#8217; was more likely to have been used for&#10;the storage of scrolls.&#160;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;Although battery research is proceeding at a steady pace, with an average annual gain in capacity&#10;of six per cent, what scientists are hoping for is that a battery will be developed that can last even&#10;longer and be lighter and smaller. One completely different technology that is being explored is&#10;to create a battery that can power a house; size would not be such an issue, but its generating&#10;capacity and length of life would have to be something totally different from what we have yet&#10;experienced.</div>",

        "content": "<div><b>Can All Reading Help Children?</b></div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;It is generally acknowledged that reading is an important part of a child&#8217;s learning process.&#10;Reading is a way for children to make connections between what they already know and what&#10;they see around them. These connections help children understand the world they are in, and,&#10;through books, children are exposed to characters and cultures that they may not otherwise&#10;interact with in real life.&#160;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;A recent debate has examined what kinds of reading are best for children and whether any type of&#10;reading is beneficial. Many children are attracted to one genre or type of book, or they may have&#10;a favourite author that they like to read time and time again. Even though children may enjoy&#10;reading a single type of literature, they can be gently introduced to other genres. &#8216;Gently&#8217; is&#10;important, because parents or teachers do not want to push too hard and run the risk of turning&#10;the child off reading. So, why is it important for children to read a variety of books and stories?&#10;Primary school teacher, Carol Anderson explains that there are several good reasons. &#8220;The&#10;exposure to different authors and genres of books can give your child insight into other societies,&#10;worldwide locations, and new vocabulary.&#8221; Child-specific genres also provide a key link from the&#10;present to the past. Anderson again explains. &#8220;These genres are often stories that are passed&#10;down from generation to generation and they can be fascinating. Folk tales, fairy tales, fables,&#10;legends and myths, while retaining much of their original flavour and content, have to evolve in&#10;subtle ways to remain meaningful in different eras. They are a great starting point to introduce&#10;children to the concept of a story and to introduce them to different types of stories or genres.&#8221;&#160;<b><br></b></div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;But is all reading good? There is so much written that is done so badly and with questionable&#10;content. But if those are the only books a reluctant reader will pick up, do their drawbacks&#10;outweigh the benefit of having the student finally turning pages? &#8220;I think you should be glad&#10;they&#8217;re reading anything at all,&#8221; says Patricia Edwards, distinguished professor of language and&#10;literacy at Michigan State University. In her area of specialisation of creating home reading&#10;environments for families, she has become accustomed to the reality that there are often not&#10;typically strong reading role models for students at the end of the day. &#8220;A lot of parents don&#8217;t&#10;have reading as a tradition and there aren&#8217;t any books they would suggest their children read. So&#10;if a student gravitates toward a book, even if it&#8217;s not a classic from the literary canon, that&#10;shouldn&#8217;t be cause for alarm.&#8221;&#10;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;Joining her in the any-reading-is-good camp is Deborah Wooten, a board member of the&#10;Children&#8217;s Literature Assembly. Children learn how language and writing work, even when reading&#160;books dismissed by some as piffle, says Wooten. Wooten is also concerned with other issues.&#10;&#8220;There is decreased readership among children and young adults because of digital distractions.&#8221;&#10;To prove her point, she cites a recent study that showed teenagers spend roughly four hours a&#10;night in front of a television or computer.</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;But plenty of parents put themselves in the opposite camp. Don Croft, a parent of a six-year-old&#10;boy, recently wrote in an online review of a book that he saw his child reading, that he had to stop&#10;after every other sentence and talk about how his child should not follow the examples he read&#10;about in this particular book. &#8220;I had to point out that we don&#8217;t call people stupid, we don&#8217;t judge&#10;others by the fact that you can beat them up, and you don&#8217;t deal with being afraid by calling&#10;everyone names and hitting them.&#8221;&#160;</div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Librarian, Mike Howard, disagrees. &#8220;The books that we believe to be poor quality may introduce&#10;students to reading. After they are hooked with these books, it is our job as educators and parents&#10;to slowly begin introducing new books to these students. As long as the students are able to&#10;develop the skill of visualising what they are reading, they are learning.&#8221; Another point of view is&#10;that &#8216;low quality literature&#8217; can give the opportunity to teach a child to be a critical thinker and&#10;that parents can use the child&#8217;s interest as a springboard for recommendations for other, more&#10;substantive literature. Author, Judy Blume, who has had her books banned by various&#10;organisations, feels that parents worry too much about their children&#8217;s reading material. &#8220;If a book&#10;is really unsuitable, the children themselves will simply self-censor themselves.&#8221; Although Blume&#10;has sold over 80 million of her books worldwide, she still finds people critical of what she has&#10;written. &#8220;A lot of people want to control everything in their children&#8217;s lives, or everything in other&#10;people&#8217;s children&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</span><br></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;</span><span>Reading for pleasure is an activity that has real consequences in the life of a child. There is a&#10;growing body of evidence that emphasises the importance of reading for pleasure, for both&#10;educational purposes as well as personal development. The evidence strongly supports the&#10;argument that those who read more are better readers and do significantly better at school.&#10;Children who read very little do not have the benefits that come with reading, and studies show&#10;that when struggling readers are not motivated to read, their opportunities to gain knowledge&#10;decrease significantly. Whether any type of reading can be considered beneficial is moot and it&#10;probably lies with parents and teachers to lay down their own beliefs in guiding children&#8217;s reading&#10;patterns.</span></div>",

Historical data are inadequate to identify the geographic source of the 1918 virus. The name &#8216;Spanish&#8217; influenza merely reflects that Spain, which was neutral in World War 1, did not censor their news agencies from publicising the severity of the pandemic in the country, and this made it seem to other countries that the disease was worse there.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph B&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; The pandemic did not occur evenly over 1918 and 1919, but came in three severe waves. The first, or so-called spring wave, began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next six months. Illness rates were high, but death rates in most locales were not appreciably above normal. A second or autumn wave spread globally from September to November 1918, was highly fatal and, in many nations, a third wave occurred in early 1919. Clinical similarities led contemporary observers to conclude initially that they were observing the same disease in the successive waves. The differences between the waves seemed to be primarily in the much higher frequency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last two waves. These three extensive pandemic waves of influenza within one year, occurring in rapid succession, with only the briefest of quieter intervals between them, were unprecedented.&#160;</span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph C&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; All of these deaths caused a severe disruption in the US economy. Claims against life insurance policies skyrocketed, with one insurance company reporting a 745 per cent rise in the number of claims made. Small businesses, many of which had been unable to operate during the pandemic, went bankrupt. The world economy as a whole was not significantly affected and the 1920&#8217;s actually heralded a growth boom, until the 1929 Wall Street Crash. The US had a great influence on world economics and, although over 650,00 people died in the US, it could have been a lot worse. Throughout history, influenza viruses have mutated and caused pandemics or global epidemics. In 1890, an especially virulent influenza pandemic struck, killing many Americans. Those who survived that pandemic and lived to experience the 1918 pandemic tended to be less susceptible to the disease and so a lot more Americans lived than would have otherwise been the case.</span><br></span></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b>&#160;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;In the years following 1919, people seemed eager to forget the pandemic. Given its devastating&#10;impact, the reasons for this forgetfulness are puzzling. It is possible, however, that the pandemic&#8217;s&#160;close association with World War I may have caused this short memory. While more people died from&#10;the pandemic than from World War I, the war had lasted longer than the pandemic and caused greater&#10;and more immediate changes in American society. Influenza hit areas quickly and often, but it&#10;disappeared within a few weeks of its arrival. Many people did not have time to fully realise just how&#10;great the danger was.&#10;<span><span><br></span></span></div><div><b>&#160;Paragraph E</b>&#160;</div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;The 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic had some curious features. Firstly, overall, nearly half of the&#10;influenza-related deaths in the 1918 pandemic were in young adults of 20 to 40 years of age, a&#10;phenomenon unique to that pandemic year. The 1918 pandemic is also unique among influenza&#10;pandemics in that the absolute risk of influenza death was higher in those under 65 years of age than&#10;in those over 65. Influenza is usually more dangerous for the very young and the old, as their immune&#10;systems are weaker. Secondly, the pandemic was particularly widespread during the summer and&#10;autumn, whilst usually influenza is more widespread in the colder winter months. Finally, in 1918, three&#10;separate recurrences of influenza followed each other with unusual rapidity, resulting in three&#10;explosive pandemic waves within a year&#8217;s time.&#160;</div><div><b>Paragraph F&#160;</b></div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160; The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was particularly fatal with more than twice the fatalities of World War&#10;1. Scientists today have isolated the virus and researched why it was so particularly lethal. The theory is&#10;that it often killed through an over-stimulation of people&#8217;s immune systems, a process known as a&#10;cytokine storm. This is when there is an overproduction of immune cells and associated compounds to&#10;fight an infection. As the infection was influenza, the cells congregated in the lungs, and their large&#10;numbers led to inflammation followed by secondary bacterial pneumonia. This secondary disease was&#10;the cause of the many deaths, particularly in healthy young adults, because of their robust immune&#10;systems that could produce so many cytokines. Ironically, the health of the young adults made them&#10;the most affected.&#160;</div><div><b>Paragraph G&#160;</b></div><div>&#160; &#160; &#160; In its disease course, the 1918 pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from previous and&#10;subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordinary number of global deaths, most influenza cases in&#10;1918 were mild and essentially indistinguishable from influenza cases today. Although laboratory&#10;experiments on influenza genes from the 1918 virus suggest that the 1918 and 1918-like viruses seem&#10;to be as sensitive as other typical virus strains to today&#8217;s anti-influenza drugs and even with today&#8217;s&#10;prevention knowledge, the return of a pandemic virus similar to the virus of 1918 would likely kill over&#10;100 million people worldwide, as the ease of travel in today&#8217;s globalised society would aid the&#10;movement of the virus. However, although some characteristics of the 1918 pandemic appear unique,&#10;scientists have concluded that, since it happened once, similar or more favourable conditions could&#10;lead to another equally devastating pandemic.</div>",

Until the late 18th century, it only grew in one place in the world: a small group of islands in the Banda Sea, part of the Moluccas &#8211; or Spice Islands &#8211; in northeastern Indonesia. The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, and produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers and pale yellow pear-shaped fruits. The fruit is encased in a fleshy husk. When the fruit is ripe, this husk splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit. Inside is a purple-brown shiny seed, 2&#8211;3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an aril. These are the sources of the two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced from the dried seed and the latter from the rail.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the spice to Europe. They sold nutmeg for high prices to merchants based in Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity. The Arab-Venetian dominance of the trade finally ended in 1512, when the Portuguese reached the Banda Islands and began exploiting its precious resources.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Always in danger of competition from neighbouring Spain, the Portuguese began subcontracting their spice distribution to Dutch traders. Profits began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch commercial fleet swiftly grew into one of the largest in the world. The Dutch quietly gained control of most of the shipping and trading of spices in Northern Europe. Then, in 1580, Portugal fell under Spanish rule, and by the end of the 16th century the Dutch found themselves locked out of the market. As prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world. The company had 50,000 employees worldwide, with a private army of 30,000 men and a fleet of 200 ships. At the same time, thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague, a highly contagious and deadly disease. Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they decided nutmeg held the cure. Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to have it. Nutmeg bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for 68,000 times its original cost on the streets of London. The only problem was the short supply. And that&#8217;s where the Dutch found their opportunity.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a neutral trading policy towards foreign powers. This allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish troops on their soil, but it also left them unprotected from other invaders. In 1621, the Dutch arrived and took over. Once securely in control of the Bandas, the Dutch went to work protecting their new investment. They concentrated all nutmeg production into a few easily guarded areas, uprooting and destroying any trees outside the plantation zones. Anyone caught growing a nutmeg seedling or carrying seeds without the proper authority was severely punished. In addition, all exported nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands. There was only one obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the Banda Islands, a sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km wide, was under the control of the British. After decades of fighting for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less valuable island in North America. The British agreed. That other island was Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became New York. The Dutch now had a monopoly over the nutmeg trade which would last for another century.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled nutmeg plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. Some of these were later exported to the Caribbean where they thrived, especially on the island of Grenada. Next, in 1778, a volcanic eruption in the Banda region caused a tsunami that wiped out half the nutmeg groves. Finally, in 1809, the British returned to Indonesia and seized the Banda Islands by force. They returned the islands to the Dutch in 1817, but not before transplanting hundreds of nutmeg seedlings to plantations in several locations across southern Asia. The Dutch nutmeg monopoly was over. Today, nutmeg is grown in Indonesia, the Caribbean, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka, and world nutmeg production is estimated to average between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes per year.</span><br></div>",

The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in manufacturing. The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the 1970s onwards led to significant cost savings and improvements in the reliability and flexibility of vehicle mass production. A new challenge to vehicle production is now on the horizon and, again, it comes from automation. However, this time it is not to do with the manufacturing process, but with the vehicles themselves. Research projects on vehicle automation are not new. Vehicles with limited self&#173; driving capabilities have been around for more than 50 years, resulting in significant contributions towards driver assistance systems. But since Google announced in 2010 that it had been trialling self-driving cars on the streets of California, progress in this field has quickly gathered pace.</font><br><p></p><div><span><br></span></div><div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>B</b>.&#160;</font><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast. One frequently cited motive is safety; indeed, research at the UK's Transport Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than 90 percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory factor, and it is the primary cause in the vast majority. Automation may help to reduce the incidence of this. Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes. If the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle. If the vehicle can do the driving, those who are challenged by existing mobility models - such as older or disabled travellers - may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>C</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Beyond these direct benefits, we can consider the wider implications for transport and society, and how manufacturing processes might need to respond as a result. At present, the average car spends more than 90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand. If a significant proportion of the population chooses to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand can be met by far fewer vehicles.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>D</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated mobility in Singapore, finding that fewer than 30 percent of the vehicles currently used would be required if fully automated car sharing could be implemented. If this is the case, it might mean that we need to manufacture far fewer vehicles to meet demand. However, the number of trips being taken would probably increase, partly because empty vehicles would have to be moved from one customer to the next. Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by 43 percent, but that vehicles' average annual mileage would double as a result. As a consequence, each vehicle would be used more intensively, and might need replacing sooner. This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle production will not necessarily decrease.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>E</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture. If we move to a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but to purchase access to a range of vehicles through a mobility provider, drivers will have the freedom to select one that best suits their needs for a particular journey, rather than making a compromise across all their requirements. Since, for most of the time, most of the seats in most cars are unoccupied, this may boost production of a smaller, more efficient range of vehicles that suit the needs of individuals. Specialised vehicles may then be available for exceptional journeys, such as going on a family camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to university.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>F</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">There are a number of hurdles to overcome in delivering automated vehicles to our roads. These include the technical difficulties in ensuring that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather and road situations it might encounter; the regulatory challenges in understanding how liability and enforcement might change when drivers are no longer essential for vehicle operation; and the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept automated vehicles as being a valuable part of the mobility landscape.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>G</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It's clear that there are many challenges that need to be addressed but, through robust and targeted research, these can most probably be conquered within the next 10 years. Mobility will change in such potentially significant ways and in association with so many other technological developments, such as telepresence and virtual reality, that it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future. However, one thing is certain: change is coming, and the need to be flexible in response to this will be vital for those involved in manufacturing the vehicles that will deliver future mobility.</font></span></div></span>",

Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part of what makes us human - indeed, this has played an important part in our success as a species. Long before the first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there were plenty of wildebeest over yonder, our ancestors had learnt the value of sending out scouts to investigate the unknown. This questing nature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread around the globe, just as it nowadays no doubt helps the last nomadic Penan maintain their existence in the depleted forests of Borneo, and a visitor negotiate the subways of New York.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Over the years, we've come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed - different from the rest of us, different from those of us who are merely 'well travelled' , even; and perhaps there is a type of person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out. That, however, doesn't take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today; and that in all sorts of professions - whether artist, marine biologist or astronomer - borders of the unknown are being tested each day.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of uncultivated land, and used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters. He is delving into matters we all recognise because they are common to humanity. This is surely an act of exploration, and into a world as remote as the author chooses. Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones. The traveller 'who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling laboriously over a country in which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain people'.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;In this book about the exploration of the earth's surface, I have confined myself to those whose travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery. But that still left me with another problem: the word 'explorer' has become associated with a past era. We think back to a golden age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the 19th century - as if the process of discovery is now on the decline, though the truth is that we have named only one and a half million of this planet's species, and there may be more than 10 million - and that's not including bacteria. We have studied only 5 per cent of the species we know. We have scarcely mapped the ocean floors, and know even less about ourselves; we fully understand the workings of only 10 percent of our brains.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Here is how some of today's 'explorers' define the word. Ran Fiennes, dubbed the 'greatest living explorer', said, 'An explorer is someone who has done something that no human has done before - and also done something scientifically useful.' Chris Bonington, a leading mountaineer, felt exploration was to be found in the act of physically touching the unknown: 'You have to have gone somewhere new.' Then Robin Hanbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote so-called 'tribal' peoples, said, 'A traveller simply records information about some far-off world, and reports back; but an explorer changes the world.' Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia's Empty Quarter in 1946, and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us, told me, 'lf I'd gone across by camel when I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt.' To him, exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great self-discovery.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Each definition is slightly different - and tends to reflect the field of endeavour of each pioneer. It was the same whoever I asked: the prominent historian would say exploration was a thing of the past, the cutting-edge scientist would say it was of the present. And so on. They each set their own particular criteria; the common factor in their approach being that they all had, unlike many of us who simply enjoy travel or discovering new things, both a very definite objective from the outset and also a desire to record their findings.</span><br></div></span></div><br><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;I'd best declare my own bias. As a writer, I'm interested in the exploration of ideas. I've done a great many expeditions and each one was unique. I've lived for months alone with isolated groups of people all around the world, even two 'uncontacted tribes'. But none of these things is of the slightest interest to anyone unless, through my books, I've found a new slant, explored a new idea. Why? Because the world has moved on. The time has long passed for the great continental voyages - another walk to the poles, another crossing of the Empty Quarter. We know how the land surface of our planet lies; exploration of it is now down to the details - the habits of microbes, say, or the grazing behaviour of buffalo. Aside from the deep sea and deep underground, it's the era of specialists. However, this is to disregard the role the human mind has in conveying remote places; and this is what interests me: how a fresh interpretation, even of a well-travelled route, can give its readers new insights.<br></div>",

Transportation is estimated to account for 30% of energy consumption in most of the world&#8217;s most developed nations, so lowering the need for energy-using vehicles is essential for decreasing the environmental impact of mobility. But as more and more people move to cities, it is important to think about other kinds of sustainable travel too. The ways we travel affect our physical and mental health, our social lives, our access to work and culture, and the air we breathe. Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities through urban design, but the engineering industry still works on the assumptions that led to the creation of the energy-consuming transport systems we have now: the emphasis placed solely on efficiency, speed, and quantitative data. We need radical changes, to make it healthier, more enjoyable, and less environmentally damaging to travel around cities.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.&#160;</b>Dance might hold some of the answers. That is not to suggest everyone should dance their way to work, however healthy and happy it might make us, but rather that the techniques used by choreographers to experiment with and design movement in dance could provide engineers with tools to stimulate new ideas in city-making. Richard Sennett, an influential urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about the way cities are made, argues that urban design has suffered from a separation between mind and body since the introduction of the architectural blueprint.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b>Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, building designs are now conceived and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the physical and social realities they are creating. While the design practices created by these new technologies are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city, they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.&#160;</b>To illustrate, Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, USA, a development typical of the modernist approach to urban planning prevalent in the 1970s. Peachtree created a grid of streets and towers intended as a new pedestrian-friendly downtown for Atlanta. According to Sennett, this failed because its designers had invested too much faith in computer-aided design to tell them how it would operate. They failed to take into account that purpose-built street caf&#233;s could not operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older buildings, and would need energy-consuming air conditioning instead, or that its giant car park would feel so unwelcoming that it would put people off getting out of their cars. What seems entirely predictable and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated into reality.<div><br></div><div><b>E.&#160;</b>The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to predict and shape the way people move through the city. Again, these models are necessary, but they are built on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered and other experiences of the city ignored. Designs that seem logical in models appear counter-intuitive in the actual experience of their users. The guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road, for example, were an engineering solution to pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of traffic. On wide major roads, they often guide pedestrians to specific crossing points and slow down their progress across the road by using staggered access points to divide the crossing into two &#8211; one for each carriageway. In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile, and encouraging others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails. These barriers don't just make it harder to cross the road: they divide communities and decrease opportunities for healthy transport. As a result, many are now being removed, causing disruption, cost, and waste.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b> If their designers had had the tools to think with their bodies &#8211; like dancers &#8211; and imagine how these barriers would feel, there might have been a better solution. In order to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities, engineering will need to develop a richer understanding of why people move in certain ways, and how this movement affects them. Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem. Yet it shares with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space. It is an art form developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body, and gaining instant feedback on how the results feel. Choreographers have deep understanding of the psychological, aesthetic, and physical implications of different ways of moving.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.&#160;</b>Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor, cognitive scientist David Kirsh described how he &#8216;thinks with the body&#8217;. Kirsh argues that by using the body to simulate outcomes, McGregor is able to imagine solutions that would not be possible using purely abstract thought. This kind of physical knowledge is valued in many areas of expertise, but currently has no place in formal engineering design processes. A suggested method for transport engineers is to improvise design solutions and get instant feedback about how they would work from their own experience of them, or model designs at full scale in the way choreographers experiment with groups of dancers. Above all, perhaps, they might learn to design for emotional as well as functional effects.</div></div>",

Flying in vast numbers across North America, with potentially many millions within a single flock, their migration was once one of nature&#8217;s great spectacles. Sadly, the passenger pigeon&#8217;s existence came to an end on 1 September 1914, when the last living specimen died at Cincinnati Zoo. Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which now aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as &#8216;de-extinction&#8217;. The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still in existence &#8211; in this case, the abundant band-tailed pigeon &#8211; before being born as a living, breathing animal. Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in this field, but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting-edge technology is being trialled.</span></font></div><div><br></div><div><b>B.&#160;</b><span><font size=\"2\">In Australia, the thylacine, more commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, is another extinct creature which genetic scientists are striving to bring back to life. &#8216;There is no carnivore now in Tasmania that fills the niche which thylacines once occupied,&#8217; explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in a &#8216;dangerously debilitating&#8217; facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils, the island&#8217;s other notorious resident. Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils. &#8216;If that contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out in whatever region it started. The return of thylacines to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind.&#8217;</font></span></div><div><br></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b><span><font size=\"2\">If extinct species can be brought back to life, can humanity begin to correct the damage it has caused to the natural world over the past few millennia? &#8216;The idea of de-extinction is that we can reverse this process, bringing species that no longer exist back to life,&#8217; says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz&#8217;s Genomics Institute. &#8216;I don&#8217;t think that we can do this. There is no way to bring back something that is 100 per cent identical to a species that went extinct a long time ago.&#8217; A more practical approach for long-extinct species is to take the DNA of existing species as a template, ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal DNA to create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which looks and/or acts like the animal which died out.</font></span></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>D.&#160;</b><span><font size=\"2\">This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question: what is the actual point of this technology? &#8216;For us, the goal has always been replacing the extinct species with a suitable replacement,&#8217; explains Novak. &#8216;When it comes to breeding, band-tailed pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two nests per hectare, whereas passenger pigeons were very social and would make 10,000 or more nests in one hectare.&#8217; Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This has left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance. According to Novak, a hybridized band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that forest disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a great many other native species to thrive.</font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><b>E.&#160;</b><span><font size=\"2\">Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth. George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the main way in which the extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ. By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the icy climate of the tundra, the project&#8217;s goal is to return mammoths, or a mammoth-like species, to the area. &#8216;My highest priority would be preserving the endangered Asian elephant,&#8217; says Church, &#8216;expanding their range to the huge ecosystem of the tundra. Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all traits found in the now extinct woolly mammoth.&#8217; This repopulation of the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions &#8211; elephants punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth. This grass growth would reduce temperature, and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost.</font></span></div><div><br></div><div><b>F.&#160;</b><span><font size=\"2\">While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might capture imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an existing species which is merely threatened with extinction. &#8216;Many of the technologies that people have in mind when they think about de-extinction can be used as a form of &#8220;genetic rescue&#8221;,&#8217; explains Shapiro. She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future. &#8216;I would also say there&#8217;s an incredible moral hazard to not do anything at all,&#8217; she continues. &#8216;We know that what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and measured risks.'</font></span></div></div>",

Laughter is universal across all human cultures and even exists in some form in rats, chimps, and bonobos. Like other human emotions and expressions, laughter and humour psychological scientists with rich resources for studying human psychology, ranging from the development of language to the neuroscience of social perception.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Theories focusing on the evolution of laughter point to it as an important adaptation for social communication. Take, for example, the recorded laughter in TV comedy shows. Back in 1950, US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live audiences, so started recording his own &#8216;laugh tracks&#8217;. These were intended to help people at home feel like they were in a social situation, such as a crowded theatre. Douglass even recorded various types of laughter, as well as mixtures of laugher from men, women, and children. In doing so, he picked up on a quality of laughter that is now interesting researchers: a simple &#8216;haha&#8217; communicates a remarkable amount of socially relevant information.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In one study conducted in 2016, samples of laughter from pairs of English-speaking </span></p><div><span><span>students were recorded at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A team made up of more than 30 psychological scientists, anthropologists, and biologists then played these recording to listeners from 24 diverse societies, from indigenous tribes in New Guinea to city-dwellers in India and Europe. Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or strangers. On average, the results were remarkably consistent: worldwide, people&#8217;s guesses were correct approximately 60% of the time.</span><br></span></div><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Researchers have also found that different types of laughter serve as codes to complex human social hierarchies. A team led by Christopher Oveis from the University of California, San Diego, found that high-status individuals had different laughs from low-status individuals, and that strangers&#8217; judgements of an individual&#8217;s social status were influenced by the dominant or submissive quality of their laughter. In their study, 48 male college students were randomly assigned to groups of four, with each group composed of two low-status members, who had just joined their college fraternity group, and two high-status members, older student took a turn at being teased by the others, involving the use of mildly insulting nicknames. Analysis revealed that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more dominant laughs and fewer submissive laughs relative to the low-status individuals. Meanwhile, low-status individuals were more likely to change their laughter based on their position of power; that is, the newcomers produced more dominant laughs when they were in the &#8216;powerful&#8217; role of teasers. Dominant laughter was higher in pitch, louder, and more variable in tone than submissive laughter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A random group of volunteers then listened to an equal number of dominant and submissive laughs from both the high- and low-status individuals, and were asked to </span><span>estimate the social status of the laughter. In line with predictions, laughers producing dominant laughs were perceived to be significantly higher in status than laughers producing submissive laughs. &#8216;This was particularly true for low-status individuals, who were rated as significantly higher in status when displaying a dominant versus submissive laugh,&#8217; Oveis and colleagues note. &#8216;Thus, by strategically displaying more dominant laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve higher status in the eyes of others.&#8217; However, high-status individuals were rated as high-status wheth</span><span>Another study, conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of Australian National University, was based on the hypothesis that humour might provide a respite from tedious situations in the workplace. This &#8216;mental break&#8217; might facilitate the replenishment of mental resources. To test this theory, the researchers recruited 74 business students, ostensibly for an experiment on perception. First, the students performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance of the letter &#8216;e&#8217; over two pages of text. The students then were randomly assigned to watch a video clip eliciting either humour, contentment, or neutral feelings. Some watched a clip of the BBC comedy Mr. Bean, others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a factual video about the management profession.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles, and were told that making 10 correct assessments in a row would lead to a win. However, the software was programmed such that is was nearly impossible to achieve 10 consecutive correct answers. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point. </span><span>Students who had watched the Mr. Bean video ended up spending significantly more time working on the task, making twice as many predictions as the other two groups.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study, during which they had participants complete long multiplication questions by hand. Again, participants who watched the humorous video spent significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed more questions correctly than did the students in either of the other groups.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate social relationships, traditional view of task performance implies that individuals should avoid things such as humour that may distract them from the accomplishment of task goals,&#8217; Cheng and Wang conclude. &#8216;We suggest that humour is not only enjoyable but more importantly, energising.&#8217;</span></p></span></span></span>",

Could it help cities face the threats to our food supplies?<br><br></i></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>On top of a striking new exhibition hall in southern Paris, the world&#8217;s largest urban rooftop farm has started to bear fruit. Strawberries that are small, intensely flavoured and resplendently red sprout abundantly from large plastic tubes. Peer inside and you see the tubes are completely hollow, the roots of dozens of strawberry plants dangling down inside them. From identical vertical tubes nearby burst row upon row of lettuces; near those are aromatic herbs, such as basil, sage and peppermint. Opposite, in narrow, horizontal trays packed not with soil but with coconut fibre, grow cherry tomatoes, shiny aubergines and brightly coloured chards.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Pascal Hardy, an engineer and sustainable development consultant, began experimenting with vertical farming and aeroponic growing towers- as the soil-free plastic tubes are known &#8211; on his Paris apartment block roof five years ago. The </span></p><div><span><span>urban rooftop space above the exhibition hall is somewhat bigger: 14,000 square metres and almost exactly the size of a couple of football pitches. Already, the team of young urban farmers who tend it have picked, in one day, 3,000 lettuces and 150 punnets of strawberries. When the remaining two thirds of the vast open area are in production, 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000 kg of perhaps 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day. &#8216;We&#8217;re not ever, obviously, going to feed the whole city this way,&#8217; cautions Hardy. &#8216;In the urban environment you&#8217;re working with very significant practical constraints, clearly, on what you can do and where. But if enough unused space can be developed like this, there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t eventually target maybe between 5% and 10% of consumption.&#8217;</span><br></span></div></span><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Perhaps most significantly, however, this is a real-life showcase for the work of Hardy&#8217;s flourishing urban agriculture consultancy, Agripolis, which is currently fielding enquiries from around the world to design, build and equip a new breed of soil-free inner-city farm. &#8216;The method&#8217;s advantages are many,&#8217; he says. &#8216;First, I don&#8217;t much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different pesticides, or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases. I don&#8217;t much like the fact, either, that they&#8217;ve travelled an average of 2,000 refrigerated kilometres to my plate, that their quality is so poor, because the varieties are selected for their capacity to withstand such substantial journeys, or that 80% of the price I pay goes to wholesalers and transport companies, not the producers.&#8217;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Produce grown using this soil-free method, on the other hand- which relies solely on a small quantity of water, enriched with organic nutrients, pumped around a closed circuit of pipes, towers and trays- is &#8216;produced up here, and sold locally, just down there. It barely travels at all,&#8217; Hardy says. &#8216;You can select crop varieties for </span></p><div><span><span>their flavour, not their resistance to the transport and storage chain, and you can pick them when they&#8217;re really at their best, and not before.&#8217; No soil is exhausted, and the water that gently showers the plants&#8217; roots every 12 minutes is recycled, so the method uses 90% less water than a classic intensive farm for the same yield.</span><br></span></div></span><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Urban farming is not, of course, a new phenomenon. Inner-city agriculture is booming from Shanghai to Detroit and Tokyo to Bangkok. Strawberries are being grown in disused shipping containers, mushrooms in underground carparks. Aeroponic farming, he says, is &#8216;virtuous&#8217;. The equipment weighs little, can be installed on almost any flat surface and is cheap to buy: roughly 100 to 150 per square metre. It is cheap to run, too, consuming a tiny fraction of the electricity used by some techniques.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Produce grown this way typically sells at prices that, while generally higher than those of classic intensive agriculture, are lower than soil-based organic growers. There are limits to what farmers can grow this way, of course, and much of the produce is suited to the summer months. &#8216;Root vegetables we cannot do, at least not yet,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Radishes are OK, but carrots, potatoes, that kind of thing- the roots are simply too long. Fruit trees are obviously not an option. And beans tend to take up a lot of space for not much return.&#8217; Nevertheless, urban farming of the kind being practised in Paris is one part of a bigger and fast-changing picture that is bringing food production closer to our lives.</span></p></span></font>",

The same tree can be valued very differently by each person who looks at it. A large, straight black cherry tree has high value as timber to be cut into logs or made into furniture, but for a landowner more interested in wildlife habitat, the real value of that stem (or trunk) may be the food it provides to animals. Likewise, if the tree suffers from black knot disease, its value for timber decreases, but to a woodworker interested in making bowls, it brings an opportunity for a unique and beautiful piece of art.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>B.</b> In the past, Pennsylvania landowners were solely interested in the value of their trees as high-quality timber. The norm was to remove the stems of highest quality and leave behind poorly formed trees that were not as well suited to the site where they grew. This practice, called &#8216;high-grading&#8217;, has left a legacy of &#8216;low-use wood&#8217; in the forests. Some people even call these &#8216;junk trees&#8217;, and they are abundant in Pennsylvania. These trees have lower economic value for traditional timber markets, compete for growth with higher-value trees, shade out desirable regeneration and decrease the health of a stand leaving it more vulnerable to poor weather and disease. Management that specifically targets low-use wood can help landowners manage these forest health issues, and wood </span><span>energy markets help promote this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>C.</b> Wood energy markets can accept less expensive wood material of lower quality than would be suitable for traditional timber markets. Most wood used for energy in Pennsylvania is used to produce heat or electricity through combustion. Many schools and hospitals use wood boiler systems to heat and power their facilities, many homes are primarily heated with wood, and some coal plants incorporate wood into their coal streams to produce electricity. Wood can also be gasified for electrical generation and can even be made into liquid fuels like ethanol and gasoline for lorries and cars. All these products are made primarily from low-use wood. Several tree- and plant-cutting approaches, which could greatly improve the long-term quality of a forest, focus strongly or solely on the use of wood for those markets.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>D.</b> One such approach is called a Timber Stand Improvement (TSI) Cut. In a TSI Cut, really poor-quality tree and plant material is cut down to allow more space, light, and other resources to the highest-valued stems that remain. Removing invasive plants might be another primary goal of a TSI Cut. The stems that are left behind might then grow in size and develop more foliage and larger crowns or tops that produce more coverage for wildlife; they have a better chance to regenerate in a less crowded environment. TSI Cuts can be tailored to one farmer&#8217;s specific management goals for his or her land.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>E. </b>Another approach that might yield a high amount of low-use wood is a Salvage Cut. With the many pests and pathogens visiting forests including hemlock wooly adelgid, Asian longhomed beetle, emerald ash borer, and gypsy moth, to name just a few, it is important to remember that those working in the forests can help ease these issues through cutting procedures. These types of cut reduce the number of sick trees and seek to manage the future spread of a </span><span>pest problem. They leave vigorous trees that have stayed healthy enough to survive the outbreak.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>F.</b> A Shelterwood Cut, which only takes place in a mature forest that has already been thinned several times, involves removing all the mature trees when other seedlings have become established. This then allows the forester to decide which tree species are regenerated. It leaves a young forest where all trees are at a similar point in their growth. It can also be used to develop a two-tier forest so that there are two harvests and the money that comes in is spread out over a decade or more.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>G.</b> Thinnings and dense and dead wood removal for fire prevention also center on the production of low-use wood. However, it is important to remember that some retention of what many would classify as low-use wood is very important. The tops of trees that have been cut down should be left on the site so that their nutrients cycle back into the soil. In addition, trees with many cavities are extremely important habitats for insect predators like woodpeckers, bats and small mammals. They help control problem insects and increase the health and resilience of the forest. It is also important to remember that not all small trees are low-use. For example, many species like hawthorn provide food for wildlife. Finally, rare species of trees in a forest should also stay behind as they add to its structural diversity.</span></p></span>",

Researchers are working to reduce these threats<br><br></i></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>A. </b>Last year, commercial companies, military and civil departments and amateurs sent more than 400 satellites into orbit, over four times the yearly average in the previous decade. Numbers could rise even more sharply if leading space companies follow through on plans to deploy hundreds to thousands of large constellations of satellites to space in the next few years.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>All that traffic can lead to disaster. Ten years ago, a US commercial Iridium satellite smashed into an inactive Russian communications satellite called Cosmos-2251, creating thousands of new pieces of space shrapnel that now threaten other satellites in low Earth orbit &#8211; the zone stretching up to 2,000 kilometres in altitude. Altogether, there are roughly 20,000 human-made objects in orbit, from working satellites to small rocket pieces. And satellite operators can&#8217;t steer away from every potential crash, because each move consumes time and fuel that could otherwise be used for the spacecraft&#8217;s main job.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>B.</b> </span><span>Concern about space junk goes back to the beginning of the satellite era, but the number of objects in orbit is rising so rapidly that researchers are investigating new ways of attacking the problem. Several teams are trying to improve methods for assessing what is in orbit, so that satellite operators can work more efficiently in ever-more-crowded space. Some researchers are now </span><span>starting to compile a massive data set that includes the best possible information on where everything is in orbit. Others are developing taxonomies of space &#8211; working on measuring properties such as the shape and size of an object, so that satellite operators know how much to worry about what&#8217;s coming their way.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The alternative, many say, is unthinkable. Just a few uncontrolled space crashes could generate enough debris to set off a runaway cascade of fragments, rendering near-Earth space unusable. &#8216;If we go on like this, we will reach a point of no return,&#8217; says Carolin Frueh, an astrodynamical researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.</span></p></span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span> <b>C. </b></span><span>Even as our ability to monitor space objects increases, so too does the total number of items in orbit. That means companies, governments and other players in space are collaborating in new ways to avoid a shared threat. International groups such as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee have developed guidelines on space sustainability. Those include inactivating satellites at the end of their useful life by venting pressurised materials or leftover fuel that might lead to explosions. The intergovernmental groups also advise lowering satellites deep enough into the atmosphere that they will burn up or disintegrate within 25 years. But so far, only about half of all missions have abided by this 25-year goal, says Holger Krag, head of the European Space Agency&#8217;s space-debris office in Darmstadt, Germany. Operators of the planned large constellations of satellites say they will be responsible stewards in their enterprises in space, but Krag worries that problems could increase, despite their best intentions. &#8216;What happens to those that fail or go bankrupt?&#8217; he asks. They are probably not going to spend money to remove their satellites from space.&#8217;&#10;&#10;<br><b><br>D. </b></span><span>In theory, given the vastness of space, satellite operators should have plenty of room for all these missions to fly safely without ever nearing another object. So some scientists are tackling the problem of space junk by trying to find out where all the debris is to a high degree of precision. That would alleviate the need for many of the unnecessary manoeuvres that are carried out to avoid potential collisions. &#8216;If you knew precisely where everything was, you would almost never have a problem,&#8217; says Marlon Sorge, a space-debris specialist at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California.<br><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>E.</b> The field is called space traffic management, because it&#8217;s similar to managing traffic on the roads or in the air. Think about a busy day at an airport, says Moriba Jah, an astrodynamicist at the University of Texas at Austin: planes line up in the sky, landing and taking off close to one another in a carefully choreographed routine. Air-traffic controllers know the location of the planes down to one metre in accuracy. The same can&#8217;t be said for space debris. Not all objects in orbit are known, and even those included in databases are not tracked consistently.&#10;&#10;<br><b><br>F. </b></span><span>An additional problem is that there is no authoritative catalogue that accurately lists the orbits of all known space debris. Jah illustrates this with a web-based database that he has developed. It draws on several sources, such as catalogues maintained by the US and Russian governments, to visualise where objects are in space. When he types in an identifier for a particular space object, the database draws a purple line to designate its orbit. Only this doesn&#8217;t quite work for a number of objects, such as a Russian rocket body designated in the database as object number 32280. When Jah enters that number, the database draws two purple lines: the US and Russian sources contain two completely different orbits for the same object. Jah says that it is almost </span><span>impossible to tell which is correct, unless a third source of information made it possible to cross-correlate.</span></p></span><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Jah describes himself as a space environmentalist: &#8216;I want to make space a place that is safe to operate, that is free and useful for generations to come.&#8217; Until that happens, he argues, the space community will continue devolving into a tragedy in whic hall spaceflight operators are polluting a common resource.</span></p></span></font>",

        "content": "<div><b><font size=\"3\">Stonehenge</font></b></div><div><b><font size=\"3\"><br></font></b></div><div><font size=\"3\">For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over the many mysteries of Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument that took an estimated 1,500 years to erect. Located on Salisbury Plain in southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Archaeologists believe England&#8217;s most iconic prehistoric ruin was built in several stages with the earliest constructed 5,000 or more years ago. First, Neolithic* Britons used primitive tools, which may have been fashioned out of deer antlers, to dig a massive circular ditch and bank, or henge. Deep pits dating back to that era and located within the circle may have once held a ring of timber posts, according to some scholars.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Several hundred years later, it is thought, Stonehenge&#8217;s builders hoisted an estimated 80 bluestones, 43 of which remain today, into standing positions and&#160;placed them in either a horseshoe or circular formation. These stones have been traced all the way to the Preseli Hills in Wales, some 300 kilometres from Stonehenge. How, then, did prehistoric builders without sophisticated tools or engineering haul these boulders, which weigh up to four tons, over such a great distance?<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">According to one long-standing theory among archaeologists, Stonehenge&#8217;s builders fashioned sledges and rollers out of tree trunks to lug the bluestones from the Preseli Hills. They then transferred the boulders onto rafts and floated them first along the Welsh coast and then up the River Avon toward Salisbury Plain; alternatively, they may have towed each stone with a fleet of vessels. More recent archaeological hypotheses have them transporting the bluestones with supersized wicker baskets on a combination of ball bearings and long grooved planks, hauled by oxen.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">As early as the 1970s, geologists have been adding their voices to the debate over how Stonehenge came into being. Challenging the classic image of industrious builders pushing, carting, rolling or hauling giant stones from faraway Wales, some scientists have suggested that it was glaciers, not humans, that carried the bluestones to Salisbury Plain. Most archaeologists have remained sceptical about this theory, however, wondering how the forces of nature could possibly have delivered the exact number of stones needed to complete the circle.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">The third phase of construction took place around 2000 BCE. At this point, sandstone slabs &#8211; known as &#8216;sarsens&#8217; &#8211; were arranged into an outer crescent or ring; some were assembled into the iconic three-pieced structures called trilithons that stand tall in the centre of Stonehenge. Some 50 of these stones are now visible on the site, which may once have contained many more. Radiocarbon dating has&#160;revealed that work continued at Stonehenge until roughly 1600 BCE, with the bluestones in particular being repositioned multiple times.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">But who were the builders of Stonehenge? In the 17th century, archaeologist John Aubrey made the claim that Stonehenge was the work of druids, who had important religious, judicial and political roles in Celtic** society. This theory was widely popularized by the antiquarian William Stukeley, who had unearthed primitive graves at the site. Even today, people who identify as modern druids continue to gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice. However, in the mid-20th century, radiocarbon dating demonstrated that Stonehenge stood more than 1,000 years before the Celts inhabited the region.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Many modern historians and archaeologists now agree that several distinct tribes of people contributed to Stonehenge, each undertaking a different phase of its construction. Bones, tools and other artefacts found on the site seem to support this hypothesis. The first stage was achieved by Neolithic agrarians who were likely to have been indigenous to the British Isles. Later, it is believed, groups with advanced tools and a more communal way of life left their mark on the site. Some believe that they were immigrants from the European continent, while others maintain that they were probably native Britons, descended from the original builders.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">If the facts surrounding the architects and construction of Stonehenge remain shadowy at best, the purpose of the striking monument is even more of a mystery. While there is consensus among the majority of modern scholars that Stonehenge once served the function of burial ground, they have yet to determine what other purposes it had.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">In the 1960s, the astronomer Gerald Hawkins suggested that the cluster of&#160;megalithic stones operated as a form of calendar, with different points corresponding to astrological phenomena such as solstices, equinoxes and eclipses occurring at different times of the year. While his theory has received a considerable amount of attention over the decades, critics maintain that Stonehenge&#8217;s builders probably lacked the knowledge necessary to predict such events or that England&#8217;s dense cloud cover would have obscured their view of the skies.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">More recently, signs of illness and injury in the human remains unearthed at Stonehenge led a group of British archaeologists to speculate that it was considered a place of healing, perhaps because bluestones were thought to have curative powers.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">--</font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">* Neolithic &#8211; The era, also known as the New Stone Age, which began around 12,000 years ago and ended around 3500 BCE<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">** Celtic &#8211; The Celts were people who lived in Britain and northwest Europe during the Iron Age from 600 BCE to 43 CE</font></div>",

        "content": "<div><b><font size=\"3\">Living with artificial intelligence</font></b></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) needs to be reliably aligned with human values, but does this mean AI will eventually have to police those values?<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">This has been the decade of AI, with one astonishing feat after another. A chess-playing AI that can defeat not only all human chess players, but also all previous human-programmed chess machines, after learning the game in just four hours? That&#8217;s yesterday&#8217;s news, what&#8217;s next? True, these prodigious accomplishments are all in so-called narrow AI, where machines perform highly specialised tasks. But many experts believe this restriction is very temporary. By mid-century, we may have artificial general intelligence (AGI) &#8211; machines that can achieve human-level performance on the full range of tasks that we ourselves can tackle.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">If so, there&#8217;s little reason to think it will stop there. Machines will be free of many of the physical constraints on human intelligence. Our brains run at slow biochemical processing speeds on the power of a light bulb, and their size is restricted by the dimensions of the human birth canal. It is remarkable what they accomplish, given these handicaps. But they may be as far from the physical limits of thought as our eyes are from the incredibly powerful Webb Space Telescope.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Once machines are better than us at designing even smarter machines, progress towards these limits could accelerate. What would this mean for us? Could we&#160;ensure a safe and worthwhile coexistence with such machines? On the plus side, AI is already useful and profitable for many things, and super AI might be expected to be super useful and super profitable. But the more powerful AI becomes, the more important it will be to specify its goals with great care. Folklore is full of tales of people who ask for the wrong thing, with disastrous consequences- King Midas, for example, might have wished that everything he touched turned to gold, but didn&#8217;t really intend this to apply to his breakfast.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">So we need to create powerful AI machines that are &#8216;human-friendly&#8217;- that have goals reliably aligned with our own values. One thing that makes this task difficult is that we are far from reliably human-friendly ourselves. We do many terrible things to each other and to many other creatures with whom we share the planet. If superintendent machines don&#8217;t do a lot better than us, we&#8217;ll be in deep trouble. We&#8217;ll have powerful new intelligence amplifying the dark sides of our own fallible natures.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">For safety&#8217;s sake, then, we want the machines to be ethically as well as cognitively superhuman. We want them to aim for the moral high ground, not for the troughs in which many of us spend some of our time. Luckily they&#8217;ll be smart enough for the job. If there are routes to the moral high ground, they&#8217;ll be better than us at finding them, and steering us in the right direction.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">However, there are two big problems with this utopian vision. One is how we get the machines started on the journey, the other is what it would mean to reach this destination. The &#8216;getting started&#8217; problem is that we need to tell the machines what they&#8217;re looking for with sufficient clarity that we can be confident they will find it &#8211; whatever &#8216;it&#8217; actually turns out to be. This won&#8217;t be easy, given that we are tribal&#160;creatures and conflicted about the ideals ourselves. We often ignore the suffering of strangers, and even contribute to it, at least indirectly. How then, do we point machines in the direction of something better?<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">As for the &#8216;destination&#8217; problem, we might, by putting ourselves in the hands of these moral guides and gatekeepers, be sacrificing our own autonomy &#8211; an important part of what makes us human. Machines who are better than us at sticking to the moral high ground may be expected to discourage some of the lapses we presently take for granted. We might lose our freedom to discriminate in favour of our own communities, for example.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Loss of freedom to behave badly isn&#8217;t always a bad thing, of course: denying ourselves the freedom to put children to work in factories, or to smoke in restaurants are signs of progress. But are we ready for ethical silicon police limiting our options? They might be so good at doing it that we won&#8217;t notice them; but few of us are likely to welcome such a future.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">These issues might seem far-fetched, but they are to some extent already here. AI already has some input into how resources are used in our National Health Service (NHS) here in the UK, for example. If it was given a greater role, it might do so much more efficiently than humans can manage, and act in the interests of taxpayers and those who use the health system. However, we&#8217;d be depriving some humans (e.g. senior doctors) of the control they presently enjoy. Since we&#8217;d want to ensure that people are treated equally and that policies are fair, the goals of AI would need to be specified correctly.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">We have a new powerful technology to deal with- itself, literally, a new way of thinking. For our own safety, we need to point these new thinkers in the right direction, and get them to act well for us. It is not yet clear whether this is possible, but if it is, it will require a cooperative spirit, and a willingness to set aside self-interest.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Both general intelligence and moral reasoning are often thought to be uniquely human capacities. But safety seems to require that we think of them as a package: if we are to give general intelligence to machines, we&#8217;ll need to give them moral authority, too. And where exactly would that leave human beings? All the more reason to think about the destination now, and to be careful about what we wish for.</font><br></div>",

A true Renaissance man, he embodied scientific spirit, artistic talent and humanist sensibilities. Five hundred years have passed since Leonardo died in his home at Chateau du Clos Luce, outside Tours, France. Yet far from fading into insignificance, his thinking has carried down the centuries and still surprises today.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>The Renaissance marked the transition from the 15th century to modernity and took place after the spread of the plague in the 14th century, which caused a global crisis resulting in some 200 million deaths across Europe and Asia. Today, the world is on the cusp of a climate crisis, which is predicted to cause widespread displacement, extinctions and death, if left unaddressed. Then, as now, radical solutions were called for to revolutionise the way people lived and safeguard humanity against catastrophe.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Around 1486 &#8211; after a pestilence that killed half the population in Milan, Italy &#8211; Leonardo turned his thoughts to urban planning problems. Following a typical Renaissance trend, he began to work on an &#8216;ideal city&#8217; project, which &#8211; due to its excessive costs &#8211; would remain unfulfilled. Yet given that unsustainable urban models are a key cause of global climate change today, it&#8217;s only natural to wonder how Leonardo might have changed the shape of modem cities.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Although the Renaissance is renowned as an era of incredible progress in art and architecture, it is rarely noted that the 15th century also marked the birth of urbanism as a true academic discipline. The rigour and method behind the conscious conception of a city had been largely missing in Western thought until the moment when prominent Renaissance men pushed forward large-scale urban projects in Italy, such as the reconfiguration of the town of Pienza and the expansion of the city of Ferrara. These works surely inspired Leonardo&#8217;s decision to rethink the design of medieval cities, with their winding and overcrowded streets and with houses piled against one another.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>It is not easy to identify a coordinated vision of Leonardo&#8217;s ideal city because of his disordered way of working with notes and sketches. But from the largest collection of Leonardo&#8217;s papers ever assembled, a series of innovative thoughts can be reconstructed regarding the foundation of a new city along the Ticino River, which runs from Switzerland into Italy and is 248 kilometres long. He designed the city for the easy transport of goods and clean urban spaces, and he wanted a comfortable and spacious city, with well-ordered streets and architecture. He recommended &#8216;high, strong walls&#8217;, with &#8216;towers and battlements of all necessary and pleasant beauty&#8217;.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>His plans for a modem and &#8216;rational&#8217; city were consistent with Renaissance ideals. But, in keeping with his personality, Leonardo included several innovations in his urban design. Leonardo wanted the city to be built on several levels, linked with vertical outdoor staircases. This design can be seen in some of today&#8217;s high-rise buildings but was unconventional at the time. Indeed, this idea of taking full advantage of the interior spaces wasn&#8217;t implemented until the 1920s and 1930s, with the birth of the Modernist movement.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>While in the upper layers of the city, people could walk undisturbed between elegant palaces and streets, the lower layer was the place for services, trade, transport and industry. But the true originality of Leonardo&#8217;s vision was its fusion of architecture and engineering. Leonardo designed extensive hydraulic plants to create artificial canals throughout the city. The canals, regulated by clocks and basins, were supposed to make it easier for boats to navigate inland. Leonardo also thought that the width of the streets ought to match the average height of the adjacent houses: a rule still followed in many contemporary cities across Italy, to allow access to sun and reduce the risk of damage from earthquakes.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Although some of these features existed in Roman cities, before Leonardo&#8217;s drawings there had never been a multi-level, compact modem city which was thoroughly technically conceived. Indeed, it wasn&#8217;t until the 19th century that some of his ideas were applied. For example, the subdivision of the city by function- with services and infrastructures located in the lower levels and wide and well-ventilated boulevards and walkways above for residents &#8211; is an idea that can be found in Georges-Eugene Haussmann&#8217;s renovation of Paris under Emperor Napoleon III between 1853 and 1870.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Today, Leonardo&#8217;s ideas are not simply valid, they actually suggest a way forward for urban planning. Many scholars think that the compact city, built upwards instead of outwards, integrated with nature (especially water systems), with efficient transport infrastructure, could help modern cities become more efficient and sustainable. This is yet another reason why Leonardo was aligned so closely with modern urban planning and centuries ahead of his time.</span><br></font></font></span></div>",

He was the seventh child of Raymond Moore and his wife Mary Baker. He studied at Castleford Grammar School from 1909 to 1915, where his early interest in art was encouraged by his teacher Alice Gostick. After leaving school, Moore hoped to become a sculptor, but instead he complied with his father&#8217;s wish that he train as a schoolteacher.&#160; He had to abandon his training in 1917 when he was sent to France to fight in the First World War.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After the war, Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, where he studied for two years. In his first year, he spent most of his time drawing. Although he wanted to study sculpture, no teacher was appointed until his second year. At the end of that year, he passed the sculpture examination and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. In September 1921, he moved to London and began three years of advanced study in sculpture.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College, Moore visited many of the London museums, particularly the British Museum, which had a wide-ranging collection of ancient sculpture. During these visits, he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and African sculpture. As he became increasingly interested in these &#8220;primitive&#8221; forms of art, he turned away from European sculptural traditions.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After graduating, Moore spent the first six months of 1925 travelling in France. When he visited the Trocadero Museum in Paris, he was impressed by a cast of a Mayan sculpture of the rain spirit. It was a male reclining figure with its knees drawn up together, and its head at a right angle to its body. Moore became fascinated with this stone sculpture, which he thought had a power and originality that no other stone sculpture possessed. He himself started carving a variety of subjects in stone, including depictions of reclining women, mother-and-child groups, and masks.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Moore&#8217;s exceptional talent soon gained recognition, and in 1926 he started work as a sculpture instructor at the Royal College. In 1933, he became a member of a group of young artists called Unit One. The aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of the emerging international movement in modern art and architecture.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Around this time, Moore moved away from the human figure to experiment with abstract shapes. In 1931, he held an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. His work was enthusiastically welcomed by fellow sculptors, but the reviews in the press were extremely negative and turned Moore into a notorious figure. There were calls for his resignation from the Royal College, and the following year, when his contract expired, he left to start a sculpture department at the Chelsea School of Art in London.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Throughout the 1930s, Moore did not show any inclination to please the British public. He became interested in the paintings of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, whose work inspired him to distort the human body in a radical way. At times, he seemed to abandon the human figure altogether. The pages of his sketchbooks from this period show his ideas for abstract sculptures that bore little resemblance to the human form.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1940, during the Second World War, Moore stopped teaching at the Chelsea School and moved to a farmhouse about 20 miles north of London. A shortage of materials forced him to focus on drawing. He did numerous small sketches of Londoners, later turning these ideas into large coloured drawings in his studio. In 1942, he returned to Castleford to make a series of sketches of the miners who worked there.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1944, Harlow, a town near London, offered Moore a commission for a sculpture depicting a family. The resulting work signifies a dramatic change in Moore&#8217;s style, away from the experimentation of the 1930s towards a more natural and humanistic subject matter. He did dozens of studies in clay for the sculpture, and these were cast in bronze and issued in editions of seven to nine copies each. In this way, Moore&#8217;s work became available to collectors all over the world. The boost to his income enabled him to take on ambitious projects and start working on the scale he felt his sculpture demanded.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Critics who had begun to think that Moore had become less revolutionary were proven wrong by the appearance, in 1950, of the first of Moore&#8217;s series of standing figures in bronze, with their harsh and angular pierced forms and distinct impression of menace. Moore also varied his subject matter in the 1950s with such works as Warrior with Shield and Falling Warrior. These were rare examples of Moore&#8217;s use of the male figure and owe something to his visit to Greece in 1951, when he had the opportunity to study ancient works of art.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In his final years, Moore created the Henry Moore Foundation to promote art appreciation and to display his work. Moore was the first modern English sculptor to achieve international critical acclaim and he is still regarded as one of the most important sculptors of the 20th century.</span><br></span></div>",

        "content": "<div><span><b>The Desolenator: producing clean water</b></span></div><div><span><b>A.</b> Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for domestic use. Two decades later Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in Southeast Asia into a portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water.<br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><b>B.</b>&#160;</span><span>The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from different places, such as the sea, rivers, boreholes and rain, and purify it for human consumption. It is particularly valuable in regions where natural groundwater reserves have been polluted, or where seawater is the only water source available.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water is both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. &#8216;I was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do,&#8217; he says.</span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>C.</b>&#160;<span>The Desolenator can produce 15 litres of drinking water per day, enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. Its main selling point is that unlike standard desalination techniques, it doesn&#8217;t require a generated power supply: just sunlight. It measures 120 cm by 90 cm, and it easy to transport, thanks to its two wheels. Water enters through a pipe, and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing and the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by the sun. The warm water flows into a small boiler (heated by a solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam. When the steam cools, it becomes distilled water. The device has a very simple filter to trap particles, and this can easily be shaken to remove them. There are two tubes for liquid coming out: one for the waste &#8211; salt from seawater, fluoride, etc. &#8211; and another for the distilled water. The performance of the unit is shown on an LCD screen and transmitted to the company which provides servicing when necessary.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>D.</b>&#160;</span><span>A recent analysis found that at least two-thirds of the world&#8217;s population lives with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen says that by 2030 half of the world&#8217;s population will be living with water stress &#8211; where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time. &#8216;It is really important that a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people,&#8217; he says. Many countries &#8216;don&#8217;t have the money for desalination plants, which are very expensive to build. They don&#8217;t have the money to operate them, they are very maintenance intensive, and they don&#8217;t have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants, so it is a really bad situation.&#8217;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>E.</b>&#160;</span><span>The device is aimed at a wide variety of users &#8211; from homeowners in the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US. The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold &#8211; those who cannot afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance, and middle-income homes that can lease their own equipment. &#8216;People in India don&#8217;t pay for a fridge outright; they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,&#8217; Janssen says. In the developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is unavailable &#8211; for camping, on boats, or for the military, for instance.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>F.</b>&#160;</span><span>Prices will vary according to where it is bought. In the developing world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000 (&#163;685) a unit, said Janssen. &#8216;We are a venture with a social mission. We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing world and humanitarian sector and that this is the way we will proceed. We do realise, though, that to be a viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,&#8217; he says.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>G.</b>&#160;</span><span>The company itself is based at Imperial College London, although Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has raised &#163;340,000 in funding so far. Within two years, he says, the company aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia, northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California.</span></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>Why fairy tales are really scary tales</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><span><i>Some people think that fairy tales are just stories to amuse children, but their universal and enduring appeal may be due to more serious reasons</i></span></span><b><br></b></div><div><span><span><i><br></i></span></span></div><div><span><span>People of every culture tell each other fairy tales but the same story often takes a variety of forms in different parts of the world. In the story of Little Red Riding Hood that European children are familiar with, a young girl on the way to see her grandmother meets a wolf and tells him where she is going. The wolf runs on ahead and disposes of the grandmother, then gets into bed dressed in the grandmother&#8217;s clothes to wait for Little Red Riding Hood. You may think you know the story &#8211; but which version? In some versions, the wolf swallows up the grandmother, while in others it locks her in a cupboard. In some stories Red Riding Hood gets the better of the wolf on her own, while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her cries and comes to her rescue.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The universal appeal of these tales is frequently attributed to the idea that they contain cautionary messages: in the case of Little Red Riding Hood, to listen to your mother, and avoid talking to strangers. &#8216;It might be what we find interesting about this story is that it&#8217;s got this survival-relevant information in it,&#8217; says anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham University in the UK. But his research suggests otherwise. &#8216;We have this huge gap in our knowledge about the history and prehistory of storytelling, despite the fact that we know this genre is an incredibly ancient one,&#8217; he says. That hasn&#8217;t stopped anthropologists, folklorists* and other academics devising theories to explain the importance of fairy tales in human society. Now Tehrani has found a way to test these ideas, borrowing a technique from evolutionary biologists.</span></span><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>To work out the evolutionary history, development and relationships among groups of organisms, biologists compare the characteristics of living species in a process called &#8216;phylogenetic analysis&#8217;. Tehrani has used the same approach to compare related versions of fairy tales to discover how they have evolved and which elements have survived longest.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Tehrani&#8217;s analysis focused on Little Red Riding Hood in its many forms, which include another Western fairy tale known as The Wolf and the Kids. Checking for variants of these two tales and similar stories from Africa, East Asia and other regions, he ended up with 58 stories recorded from oral traditions. Once his phylogenetic analysis had established that they were indeed related, he used the same methods to explore how they have developed and altered over time.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>First he tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story alter least as it evolves, indicating their importance. Folklorists believe that what happens in a story is more central to the story than the characters in it &#8211; that visiting a relative, only to be met by a scary animal in disguise, is more fundamental than whether the visitor is a little girl or three siblings, or the animal is a tiger instead of a wolf.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>However, Tehrani found no significant difference in the rate of evolution of incidents compared with that of characters. &#8216;Certain episodes are very stable because they are crucial to the story, but there are lots of other details that can evolve quite freely,&#8217; he says. Neither did his analysis support the theory that the central section of a story is the most conserved part. He found no significant difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the beginning or the end.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>But the really big surprise came when he looked at the cautionary elements of the story. &#8216;Studies on hunter-gatherer folk tales suggest that these narratives include really important information about the environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there &#8211; stuff that&#8217;s relevant to survival,&#8217; he says. Yet in his analysis such elements were just as flexible as seemingly trivial details. What, then, is important enough to be reproduced from generation to generation?<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The answer, it would appear, is fear &#8211; blood-thirsty and gruesome aspects of the story, such as the eating of the grandmother by the wolf, turned out to be the best preserved of all. Why are these details retained by generations of storytellers, when other features are not? Tehrani has an idea: &#8216;In an oral context, a story won&#8217;t survive because of one great teller. It also needs to be interesting when it&#8217;s told by someone who&#8217;s not necessarily a great storyteller.&#8217; Maybe being swallowed whole by a wolf, then cut out of its stomach alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain popular, no matter how badly it&#8217;s told.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is unconvinced by Tehrani&#8217;s views on fairy tales. &#8216;Even if they&#8217;re gruesome, they won&#8217;t stick unless they matter,&#8217; he says. He believes the perennial theme of women as victims in stories like Little Red Riding Hood explains why they continue to feel relevant. But Tehrani points out that although this is often the case in Western versions, it is not always true elsewhere. In Chinese and Japanese versions, often known as The Tiger Grandmother, the villain is a woman, and in both Iran and Nigeria, the victim is a boy.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University in Denmark isn&#8217;t surprised by Tehrani&#8217;s findings. &#8216;Habits and morals change, but the things that scare us, and the fact that we seek out entertainment that&#8217;s designed to scare us &#8211; those are constant,&#8217; he says. Clasen believes that scary stories teach us what it feels like to be afraid without having to experience real danger, and so build up resistance to negative emotions.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div>--</div><div><br></div><div>*Folklorists: those who study traditional stories<br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>The Great Fire of London</b></div><div><span><b><span>Paragraph A</span><br></b></span></div><div><span><span>The Great Fire of London swept through London in September 1666, devastating many buildings, including 13,200 houses and 87 parish churches. The Royal Exchange, the Guildhall and St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, all built during the Middle Ages, were also all totally destroyed. Although the verified death toll was only six people, it is unknown how many people died in the Great Fire of London, because many more died through indirect causes. The financial losses caused by the fire were estimated to be &#163;10 million, at a time when London&#8217;s annual income was only &#163;12,000. Many people were financially ruined and debtors&#8217; prisons became over-crowded.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph B</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The Great Fire of London started on Sunday, 2 September 1666 in a baker&#8217;s shop in Pudding Lane, belonging to Thomas Farynor. Although he claimed to have extinguished the fire, three hours later, at 1 a.m., his house was a blazing inferno. It is not certain how the fire actually began, but it is likely that it may have been caused by a spark from Farynor&#8217;s oven falling onto a pile of fuel nearby. In 1979, archaeologists excavated the remains of a burnt out shop on Pudding Lane that was very close to the bakery where the fire started. In the cellar, they found the charred remnants of 20 barrels of pitch. Pitch burns very easily and would have helped to spread the fire.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph C</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The fire spread quickly down Pudding Lane and carried on down Fish Hill and towards the Thames. The fire continued to spread rapidly, helped by a strong wind from the east. When it reached the Thames, it hit warehouses that were stocked with combustible products, such as oil and rope. Fortunately, the fire could not spread south of the river, because a previous blaze in 1633 had already wrecked a section of London Bridge. As the fire was spreading so quickly, most Londoners concentrated on escaping rather than fighting the fire.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph D</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>In the 17th century, people were not as aware of the dangers of fire as they are today. Buildings were made of timber covered in pitch and tightly packed together. The design of buildings meant flames could easily spread from building to building. Following a long, dry summer, the city was suffering a drought; water was scarce and the wooden houses had dried out, making them easier to burn.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph E</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>Samuel Pepys, a diarist of the period and Clerk to the Royal Navy, observed the fire and recommended to the King that buildings should be pulled down, as it could be the only way to stop the fire. The Mayor made the order to pull down burning houses using fire hooks, but the fire continued to spread. Pepys then spoke to the Admiral of the Navy and they agreed that they should blow up houses in the path of the fire. The hope was that by doing this, they would create a space to stop the fire spreading from house to house. The Navy carried out the request and by the next morning, the fire has been successfully stopped.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph F</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>London had to be almost totally reconstructed and many people went to the fields outside London. They stayed there for many days, sheltering in tents and shacks and some people were forced to live in this way for months and even years. Throughout 1667, people cleared rubble and surveyed the burnt area. Much time was spent planning new street layouts and drawing up new building regulations. Public buildings were paid for with money from a new coal tax, but by the end of the year only 150 new houses had been built. The new regulations were designed to prevent such a disaster happening again. Houses now had to be faced in brick instead of wood. Some streets were widened and two new streets were created. Pavements and new sewers were laid, and London&#8217;s quaysides were improved. Initially, however, only temporary buildings were erected that were ill-equipped, and this enabled the plague, which was common in London at that time, to spread easily. Many people died from this and the harsh winter that followed the fire.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><b><span>Paragraph G</span><br></b></span></div><div><span><span>In 1666, there was no organised fire brigade. Fire fighting was very basic with little skill or knowledge involved. Leather buckets, axes and water squirts were used to fight the fire, but they had little effect. As a result of the Great Fire of London, early fire brigades were formed by insurance companies. Building insurance was very profitable and many more insurance companies were set up, establishing their own fire brigades. These brigades were sent to insured properties if a fire occurred to minimise damage and cost. Firemarks were used to identify - and advertise - different insurance companies. They were placed on the outside of an insured building and brigades would use them to determine whether a building was insured by them. If a building was on fire, several brigades would attend. If they did not see their specific firemark attached to the building, they would leave the property to burn. Some old firemarks can still be seen on London buildings today. Also, fire fighters wore uniforms to distinguish themselves from rival insurance brigades. Although this was a step in the right direction, fire fighters received little training and the equipment used remained very basic.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Pitch &#8211; A thick liquid made from petroleum or coal tar.</div></span></span></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>A New Threat in Yellowstone</b></div><div><span><span>It has long been known that Yellowstone National Park lies over an enormous supervolcano. The term &#8216;supervolcano&#8217; implies a volcanic centre that has had an eruption of magnitude 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), meaning the measured deposits for that eruption are greater than 1,000 cubic kilometres. This sounds worrying and Professor George Peters details the possible results if something were to happen. &#8220;A major eruption would obliterate the surroundings within a radius of hundreds of kilometres, and cover the rest of the United States and Canada with multiple inches of ash. This would shut down agriculture and cause global climate cooling for as long as a decade.&#8221; To calm everyone down, geologist, Tony Masters, explains there is little to fear today. &#8220;All VEI 8 eruptions, including the last at Yellowstone, occurred tens of thousands to millions of years ago. Another eruption could occur, but it is very unlikely to happen in the next million years or so.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Yellowstone is no stranger to controversy. There was a previous media accusation that US Geological Survey (USGS) geologists had not done their work properly and that the identification of Yellowstone as a supervolcano was not done until scientists looked at photographs of Yellowstone from space. The Yellowstone scientists denied this. Spokesman Alice Wheeler clarifies their position. &#8220;The scientist who first identified the three Yellowstone calderas was from the USGS and he told the world about the great eruptions that formed them. He traced out the caldera boundaries through old fashioned field work, walking around with a hammer and hand lens and looking carefully at the rocks and their distributions.&#8221; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also agreed. Stan Forsyth, their spokesman, explains. &#8220;Several authors have written that these large calderas in Yellowstone were discovered from space, but we suspect that the rumour probably got started because initial field work that identified them was partly funded by NASA.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>A new problem in Yellowstone is that the supervolcano has now been discovered to be larger than originally thought and this has made people feel more nervous. Seismologists at the University of Utah have worked with several other institutions to create an image of the Yellowstone magma reservoir using a technique called seismic tomography. Masters student, Julia Grey, explains the results. &#8220;By looking closely at data from thousands of earthquakes, we have discovered that there are two magma reservoirs, one shallow and one deep, and that they are much larger than originally believed. The shallow one was previously known about to us, but the deeper one is a new finding.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>To create an image of this second magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone, the research teams reviewed data from thousands of earthquakes. Seismic waves travel slower through hot, partially molten rock and faster in cold, solid rock. The researchers made a map of the locations where seismic waves travel more slowly, which provided a sub-surface image of the hot or partially molten bodies in the crust beneath Yellowstone. The deeper magma storage region extends from 20 to 50 kilometres depth, contains about 2 per cent melt, and is about 4.5 times larger than the shallow magma body. The shallower magma storage region is about 90 kilometres long, extends from 5 to 17 kilometres depth,&#160;</span></span><span>and is 2.5 times larger than a prior, less accurate, study indicated. This magma reservoir contains between about 5 to 15 per cent molten rock. Although this is the crustal magma storage region that has fuelled Yellowstone&#8217;s past volcanic activity, magma typically does not erupt unless it has greater than 50 per cent melt.</span><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The US and world media were quick to dramatise the finding and exaggerate the threat that these findings represent. Yellowstone park scientist, Amy Brent, has calming words. &#8220;These findings do not increase the assessment of volcanic hazard for Yellowstone. The inferred magma storage region is no larger than we already knew. The research simply makes a better image of the magmatic system. Simply, we have more key information about how the Yellowstone volcano works.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Many independent reports back up Brent&#8217;s comments and have shown that the Yellowstone area has been on a long cycle of periodic eruptions. Eruptions are extremely infrequent in supervolcanos, and eventually the cycle ends in their deaths. US government geologist, Andrea Haller, explains the state of the Yellowstone supervolcano. &#8220;By investigating the patterns of behaviour in two previously completed caldera cycles, we can suggest that the current activity of Yellowstone is on the dying cycle.&#8221; This is based on comparisons with other supervolcanos. Scientists know the behaviour of the past and they know at what comparative stage Yellowstone is right now. It is believed that Yellowstone is currently on a third and dying cycle. This can be concluded by the fact that dying volcanos produce less fresh molten material from the Earth&#8217;s crust. Haller continues. &#8220;We&#8217;ve observed a lot of material in the magma chambers that represent recycled volcanic rocks, which were once buried inside of calderas and are now getting reused. Yellowstone has erupted enough of this material already to suggest that the future melting potential of the crust is getting exhausted.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Whatever the truth about Yellowstone, it seems that during the lives of most people, the geological status of Yellowstone can still prove hazardous. The park has often been closed due to volcanic activity in the past and this is likely to happen again before the volcano becomes harmless.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Caldera &#8211; an enormous volcano crater.</div><div>Magma &#8211; melted rock.</div></span></span></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>The Psychology of Wealth</b><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>What stops people from succeeding financially and having on-going prosperity in their life? The answer is generally focused around the belief that financial success is not a possibility. There are many people who have barriers of which they are unaware that prevent them from having the wealth and abundance that they deserve.<br></div><div><br></div><div>At a conscious level, most people think they are doing everything possible to achieve their goals. However, there still might be some unwitting part of them that does not believe they can obtain success. The more that unconscious part is avoided, the more a person will be blocked in their everyday life. Another problem is that, instead of focusing on all the possible ways to get rich, many people have an obsession about what they do not have. An interesting pattern develops in which they can become angry or resentful over their situation and this in turn can limit these people in their lives more and more. Individuals would find it so much easier to get ahead in life with a peaceful state of mind, rather than an angry or resentful one.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A first step in understanding the unconscious patterning of a person&#8217;s financial situation is to explore the deeper nature of how they represent money. For example, a person with money issues may have had parents who lived in poverty, and they subsequently formed a &#8216;Depression Era&#8217; mentality. An unconscious belief can develop that he or she will always have to struggle financially, because that is what their parents did. Alternatively, the person might have had a parent tell them over and over again that they will never be successful, and eventually they begin to believe it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is very common for children to unconsciously form limiting beliefs around money at an early age. In the field of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), these types of limiting beliefs are referred to as &#8216;imprints.&#8217; An imprint is basically a memory that is formed at an early age, and can serve as a root for both the limiting and empowering beliefs that people form as children. Some of the beliefs that people may develop at early ages are not always healthy, and are created as a result of a traumatic or confusing experience that they have forgotten. How we unconsciously and consciously view the world in terms of money is often based on such beliefs.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A primary and fundamental psychological difference between those who do well financially and those who do not revolves around beliefs. For example, many people do not even view financial success as an option. They do not have the capability to open themselves up to all of the possibilities that are available for achieving prosperity and they will nearly always get stuck in a monthly routine, so that they are unwilling to take risks or try something different, because they are afraid that they will end up being even worse off than before.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another issue can be that people become over-absorbed with the idea of making money and this can be extremely unhealthy. Money does not determine who you are; it&#8217;s simply a resource. There is a term called &#8216;affluenza,&#8217; which has been defined as &#8220;a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more.&#8221; Affluenza is an unsustainable and seriously unhealthy addiction to personal and societal economic growth. It is most acute in those who inherit wealth and seem to have no purpose or direction. For those with wealth or for those who desire it more than anything, abandoning the urge for more can often be the key to being more successful, and certainly happier. Once people stop equating their self-worth with money, then the doors of possibility can swing open for them, because they are willing to try more things. Once they start feeling better about themselves, they become less fearful and can be open to trying something completely different.<br></div><div><br></div><div>So, can money make people happy? Research shows that it does up to a point, after which there are diminishing returns, so that the extremely wealthy are no happier than the comfortably well off. Rich nations are generally happier than poor ones, but the relationship is far from consistent; other factors like political stability, freedom and security also play a part. Research likewise shows that the money- happiness connection seems to be stronger for people paid hourly than those on a salary. This is presumably because salaried people can more easily compensate with career satisfaction. Money can also impair the ability to enjoy the simple things in life, which rather offsets the happiness that wealth brings.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Money can also impair people&#8217;s satisfaction in their play and humanitarian works. When someone has done something out of the goodness of their heart, they can be insulted by offers of payment. Experiments show that paying people derisory amounts of money for their work results in them enjoying it less and doing it less well than if they had no pay at all. The capacity for a reward to undermine a person&#8217;s intrinsic pleasure in work performance has been demonstrated neurologically.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, people need to realise that their own attitudes to wealth can affect their chances of acquiring both money and happiness. As a person begins to embrace self worth and open himself or herself up to the idea of what is possible, he or she will attract wealth and prosperity into their life. The outer world is truly a reflection of people&#8217;s inner worlds. If someone feels good inside, generally it will show on the outside and they will draw positive experiences into their life.<br></div>",

They are found from India, throughout southeast Asia and New Guinea, across to northern Australia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. They are most commonly seen in tidal reaches, as this usually gives them the combination of safety and significant access to food. In spite of their name, salt-water crocodiles also occur in freshwater lagoons, rivers, and swamps hundreds of kilometres inland from the coast.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b><br></div><div>Adult males are on average 5 metres long and weigh more than 450 kilograms, whereas females are much smaller, generally around 3 metres long and up to 150 kilograms. There are uncommon records of male salt-water crocodiles reaching more than 7 metres in length and 1000 kilograms in weight. The upper body is grey, brown or almost black above, with irregular darker mottling; they are generally whitish on the underside. The snout of an adult is broad and granular; the distance from the tip to the centre of the eyes is less than twice the width of the head at eye level. The tail is highly muscular and is the main propulsion mechanism used in the water. Juveniles are generally pale tan in colour, with black stripes and spots on the body and tail.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b><br></div><div>The wet season is the time that the salt-water crocodile nests. Courtship occurs 4 to 6 weeks before nesting and continues through the nesting period. Large males control a territory through aggression, and consequently fertilise most reproductively active females within it. During courting, the females approach the males and an elaborate process of swimming together, body contact and rubbing follows. The salt-water crocodile is a mound nester, preferring areas with tall vegetation and permanent water close by. One clutch with an average of 52 to 60 eggs is laid per season. Eggs are ovoid in shape and measure approximately 8 centimetres in length, 5 centimetres in width and weigh 113 grams. Incubation time varies between 65 and 114 days, with the adult female remaining nearby to defend the nest throughout this period. The temperature of the nest is determined by heat generated within the nest and the external ambient temperature, and this is important as the temperature of the nest determines the sex of the hatchlings. Males are produced between 31 to 33 degrees Celsius and females dominate the ratios above and below these temperatures. Once the eggs hatch, the adult female excavates the nest after hearing the calls of the hatchlings and carries them to the water<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b><br></div><div>Salt-water crocodiles use the water, sun and shade to maintain their preferred body temperature of 30 to 33 degrees Celsius. When basking, they orientate their bodies to ensure the maximum surface area is exposed to the sun. All crocodiles are unable to sweat. To avoid over-heating, they may return to the water or lie with their jaws agape, allowing cool air to circulate over the skin in their mouths. This process of heating and cooling their bodies is called thermoregulation and is crucial for many bodily functions, including digestion and locomotion, and ultimately for their survival. Often observed basking on the banks of watercourses where they are generally inactive, salt-water crocodiles are less likely to be seen when they are in the water.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b><br></div><div>Salt-water crocodiles are one of the few reptiles to have a four-chambered heart, like mammals. They can also stay underwater for extended periods of time, because they have the ability to slow their heart rate, allowing them to hold their breath. A particular feature of salt-water crocodiles is their inability to maintain strenuous activity for extended periods of time and they can easily become exhausted while capturing prey or fighting other crocodiles. Extreme exertion is carried out anaerobically and must be followed by a period of rest so that the oxygen debt can be repaid to their muscles. One result of this anaerobic activity is a build-up of lactic acid in the blood. Although crocodiles can withstand higher levels of blood acidity than other animals, it can sometimes be fatal.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b><br></div><div>Until 1974, salt-water crocodiles were hunted to the brink of extinction for their skins. In Australia&#8217;s Northern Territory for example, as few as 3000 salt-water crocodiles were present when hunting ceased. Today, the total Australian population is currently estimated to be approximately a hundred thousand salt-water crocodiles, although some biologists estimate the population is even higher. It is estimated that less than one per cent of eggs laid by salt-water crocodiles hatch and survive to adulthood, and overheating, flooding and predation claim a high proportion of unhatched embryos. From the small numbers that do hatch, more than half die in their first year of life, mainly from predation by birds of prey, fish, snake-necked turtles and other crocodiles. Once they have reached maturity, their only enemies are each other and humans. Habitat destruction by people is now considered a major threat to Australian salt-water crocodiles.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b><br></div><div>Australia is one of the very few places in the world where salt-water crocodiles have a good chance of survival in the wild. As apex predators, they are an important part of the food chain and as such cull vulnerable prey, such as the old, injured, sick, or very young, leaving more food for the survival and prosperity of healthy prey animals. This helps keep the Australian wetland environments healthy and stable, and so protecting the &#8216;saltie&#8217; is vitally important. This means Australians have a responsibility to conserve and manage the country&#8217;s crocodile populations carefully.<br></div>",

He published his results in 1800, which earned him the opportunity to start lecturing at the new Royal Institution of Great Britain in the same year. His lectures were surprisingly successful, even beyond narrow scientific circles, and enabled him to meet and befriend some of the most important figures of the day.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Davy moved to London in 1801 to work at the Royal Institution as Assistant Lecturer. He proved to be an extremely gifted lecturer and was promoted to Professor of Chemistry the following year. Davy was famous for his lectures, which were so popular that a one-way system was put in place in Albemarle Street to cope with the traffic, but he was also interested in pursuing chemical research in the Royal Institution laboratories. Much of Davy&#8217;s important work in the first decade of the nineteenth century focused on the relationship between chemistry and electricity. Having concluded that electrolytic cells generated electrical energy through a chemical process, he speculated that electrolysis might be used to decompose substances into their elements. Although he overestimated the ability of electrolysis, he did successfully isolate sodium and potassium, and was the first to discover boron, hydrogen telluride, and hydrogen phosphide. He was later instrumental in identifying other elements such as chlorine and iodine, which had been discovered, but were thought to be compounds.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1812, Davy was knighted and married a wealthy widow, Jane Apreece, who gave him a son, Jack, in the same year. He then retired from lecturing, although not from research. His last important act at the Royal Institution, of which he remained honorary professor, was to interview the young Michael Faraday, later to become one of England&#8217;s great scientists, who became laboratory assistant there in 1813 and accompanied Davy on a European tour. Davy&#8217;s fame was such that he was granted special permission to travel to the continent to meet with other famous scientists. However, the political situation was fragile and the trip had to be cut short in 1815 on Napoleon&#8217;s escape from Elba. With the aid of a small portable laboratory and of various institutions in France and Italy, he conducted further investigations on various compounds of iodine and chlorine. He also analysed many specimens of classical pigments and proved that diamond is a form of carbon.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1819, by order of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Mines, Davy studied the conditions under which mixtures of firedamp and air explode. This led to the invention of the helmet lamp and to subsequent researches on flame, for which he received the Rumford medals from the Royal Society.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After this, Davy examined various magnetic phenomena caused by electricity and electrochemical methods and explored whether they, in combination with iron and zinc plates, could prevent saltwater corrosion to the copper sheathing on ships. Though the protective principles were made clear, considerable fouling still occurred, and the method&#8217;s failure greatly vexed him.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Davy&#8217;s health was by then failing rapidly. In 1827, he departed for Europe and, in the summer, was forced to resign the presidency of the Royal Society. Having to forgo business and field sports, Davy wrote a book on fishing (something he&#8217;d always enjoyed) in the same year that contained engravings from his own drawings. After a last, short visit to England, he returned to Italy, settling in Rome in February 1829. Though partly paralysed from a stroke, he spent his last months writing a series of dialogues, which were later released posthumously. While touring in 1829, Davy suffered a further severe stroke and died in Geneva in 1829. Davy had wished to be buried where he died, but had also wanted the burial deferred in case he was only comatose. However, the laws of Geneva did not allow any delay and it was performed a few days later.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div>One of Davy&#8217;s creations that we are in contact nearly every day is the light bulb, which he invented in 1801. He was experimenting with electricity around 1800 when he invented an electric battery. When he later connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light, which is now called an electric arc. It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but it did demonstrate the principle. By 1806, he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the Royal Society in London. This was soon developed into the basic light bulb that we know today, which is a glass envelope containing a combination of inert gases at low pressure. The current enters through a contact at the bottom end, just below the screw cap. Connecting wires come up through a glass fuse enclosure. From this, a filament comes up, surrounded by support wires and the electric arc is derived from this.<span><span><br></span></span></div>",

Despite scientific consensus that recommended vaccines are safe and effective, scares regarding their safety still occur today, resulting in regular disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Parental refusal of vaccines, or &#8216;vaccine hesitancy&#8217; as it is sometimes called, is therefore a growing concern for the increased occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children and the reasons for this vary widely. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations, so that they are more spread out. A large subset of parents who allow their children to be vaccinated, have also admitted to being worried and having questions about the vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited reasons for hesitancy, so they are better prepared to educate their patients&#8217; families. Education is a key element in equipping parents with the necessary information, so that they can make responsible immunisation decisions for their children.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In the United States, all fifty states require that children be vaccinated in order to go to public school. There are some variations in which immunisations are required and when, but throughout the U.S., there is an expectation that going to school means getting shots. However, in all fifty states, there are ways to get out of being vaccinated, usually by saying that vaccination goes against people&#8217;s individual convictions. However, a significant underlying reason why parents are refusing is that they just don&#8217;t think vaccines are necessary. In essence, we are victims of our own success. Vaccines have done such a good job that many people no longer remember the horrific range of vaccine-preventable diseases</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Another problem is that people who choose not to vaccinate often live in the same communities. This isn&#8217;t surprising, given that people&#8217;s social networks influence their choices. However, when groups of unimmunised people live together, it completely disrupts the whole concept of herd immunity. Vaccine-preventable diseases can easily take root and spread. While it&#8217;s important that parents in general have the right to choose whether or not their child gets a medical treatment &#8211; and vaccines are a medical treatment &#8211; the vaccination choice is fundamentally different in that it affects not just the child, but also the entire community. Choosing not to vaccinate is dangerous for the child and it&#8217;s dangerous for everyone around that child. Individual beliefs should not give anyone the right to put the health of others at risk.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Some parents believe that vaccines can cause the diseases that they are meant to prevent. Properly formulated vaccines cannot do this, however, as they either use weakened or inactive viruses. These types of vaccine help people develop immunity by imitating an infection. The type of infection a vaccine causes, however, does not cause illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce&#160;</span></span><span>antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever, but such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of &#8216;memory&#8217; cells that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. However, as it typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce antibodies, it is possible that a person who was infected with a disease just before or just after vaccination could develop symptoms and get the disease, because the vaccine had not had enough time to provide protection.</span><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The informative interaction between health providers and doubtful parents is vital for ensuring the protection of children through vaccination, but these interactions can sometimes be difficult for the health providers. Research has shown that most GP&#8217;s and immunising nurses found discussions with parents who decline to vaccinate their children to be challenging and that they felt that these parents cast doubt on their integrity. These encounters also stimulated strong internal conflict; many providers felt their professional obligations to the child and the community conflicted with the primarily bureaucratic function of exempting parents from complying with the recommended immunisation schedule. A number of professionals also can begrudge being called upon to sign exemption forms at all.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>If pharmacists and other health care providers are able to understand the main concerns parents have about vaccinating their children, they can be better prepared to have informative conversations about immunisations and they will also be able to provide the information parents need to make the bestinformed decisions for their children. Parents who are hesitant to vaccinate or who refuse vaccines care about their children and want to do what they can to protect them, just like any other parent. It is important for practitioners to have open and frank conversations with their patients and their families so that the families will understand the benefits of vaccination without undergoing judgement for having questions about their child&#8217;s healthcare.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The education patients have been exposed to has resulted in modest improvement in terms of affecting parents&#8217; attitudes about immunisation, but the tools healthcare providers should use for this have not been fully discovered. Understanding the source of parents&#8217; questions can equip pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers to speak with patients on a more relatable level and to speak in ways that parents value the most. All healthcare workers should make an effort to know about the recommended vaccines and to understand why those immunisations are recommended. This information will allow families to have face-to-face access to reliable information that can help them to make the best decisions for the society they live in.</span><br></span></div>",

It is also one of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth. It hardly ever rains there, and the only year-round source of water is located tens of metres below the surface. This is why the huarango tree is so suited to life there: it has the longest roots of any tree in the world. They stretch down 50-80 metres and, as well as sucking up water for the tree, they bring it into the higher subsoil, creating a water source for other plant life.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dr David Beresford-Jones, archaeobotanist at Cambridge University, has been studying the role of the huarango tree in landscape change in the Lower Ica Valley in southern Peru. He believes the huarango was key to the ancient people&#8217;s diet and, because it could reach deep water sources, it allowed local people to withstand years of drought when their other crops failed. But over the centuries huarango trees were gradually replaced with crops. Cutting down native woodland leads to erosion, as there is nothing to keep the soil in place. So when the huarangos go, the land turns into a desert. Nothing grows at all in the Lower Ica Valley now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For centuries the huarango tree was vital to the people of the neighbouring Middle Ica Valley too. They grew vegetables under it and ate products made from its seed pods. Its leaves and bark were used for herbal remedies, while its branches were used for charcoal for cooking and heating, and its trunk was used to build houses. But now it is disappearing rapidly. The majority of the huarango forests in the valley have already been cleared for fuel and agriculture &#8211; initially, these were smallholdings, but now they&#8217;re huge farms producing crops for the international market.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;Of the forests that were here 1,000 years ago, 99 per cent have already gone,&#8217; says botanist Oliver Whaley from Kew Gardens in London, who, together with ethnobotanist Dr William Milliken, is running a pioneering project to protect and restore the rapidly disappearing habitat. In order to succeed, Whaley needs to get the local people on board, and that has meant overcoming local prejudices. &#8216;Increasingly aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your home or street, it shows you are poor, and still need to grow your own food,&#8217; he says. In order to stop the Middle Ica Valley going the same way as the Lower Ica Valley, Whaley is encouraging locals to love the huarangos again. &#8216;It&#8217;s a process of cultural resuscitation,&#8217; he says. He has already set up a huarango festival to reinstate a sense of pride in their eco-heritage, and has helped local schoolchildren plant thousands of trees.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;In order to get people interested in habitat restoration, you need to plant a tree that is useful to them,&#8217; says Whaley. So, he has been working with local families to attempt to create a sustainable income from the huarangos by turning their products into foodstuffs. &#8216;Boil up the beans and you get this thick brown syrup like molasses. You can also use it in drinks, soups or stews.&#8217; The pods can be ground into flour to make cakes, and the seeds roasted into a sweet, chocolatey &#8216;coffee&#8217;. &#8216;It&#8217;s packed full of vitamins and minerals,&#8217; Whaley says.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>And some farmers are already planting huarangos. Alberto Benevides, owner of Ica Valley&#8217;s only certified organic farm, which Whaley helped set up, has been planting the tree for 13 years. He produces syrup and flour, and sells these products at an organic farmers&#8217; market in Lima. His farm is relatively small and doesn&#8217;t yet provide him with enough to live on, but he hopes this will change. &#8216;The organic market is growing rapidly in Peru,&#8217; Benevides says. &#8216;I am investing in the future.&#8217;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>But even if Whaley can convince the local people to fall in love with the huarango again, there is still the threat of the larger farms. Some of these cut across the forests and break up the corridors that allow the essential movement of mammals, birds and pollen up and down the narrow forest strip. In the hope of counteracting this, he&#8217;s persuading farmers to let him plant forest corridors on their land. He believes the extra woodland will also benefit the farms by reducing their water usage through a lowering of evaporation and providing a refuge for bio-control insects.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;If we can record biodiversity and see how it all works, then we&#8217;re in a good position to move on from there. Desert habitats can reduce down to very little,&#8217; Whaley explains. &#8216;It&#8217;s not like a rainforest that needs to have this huge expanse. Life has always been confined to corridors and islands here. If you just have a few trees left, the population can grow up quickly because it&#8217;s used to exploiting water when it arrives.&#8217; He sees his project as a model that has the potential to be rolled out across other arid areas around the world. &#8216;If we can do it here, in the most fragile system on Earth, then that&#8217;s a real message of hope for lots of places, including Africa, where there is drought and they just can&#8217;t afford to wait for rain.&#8217;</span></p><div><span><br></span></div></span></div>",

Researchers say that Silbo activates parts of the brain normally associated with spoken language, suggesting that the brain is remarkably flexible in its ability to interpret sounds as language.</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>&#8216;Science has developed the idea of brain areas that are dedicated to language, and we are starting to understand the scope of signals that can be recognised as language,&#8217; says David Corina, co-author of a recent study and associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle.</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>Silbo is a substitute for Spanish, with individual words receded into whistles which have high- and low-frequency tones. A whistler &#8212; or silbador &#8212; puts a finger in his or her mouth to increase the whistle&#8217;s pitch, while the other hand can be cupped to adjust the direction of the sound. &#8216;There is much more ambiguity in the whistled signal than in the spoken signal,&#8217; explains lead researcher Manuel Carreiras, psychology professor at the University of La Laguna on the Canary island of Tenerife. Because whistled &#8216;words&#8217; can be hard to distinguish, silbadores rely on repetition, as well as awareness of context, to make themselves understood.</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>The silbadores of Gomera are traditionally shepherds and other isolated mountain folk, and their novel means of staying in touch allows them to communicate over distances of up to 10 kilometres. Carreiras explains that silbadores are able to pass a surprising amount of information via their whistles. &#8216;In daily life they use &#8216;whistles to communicate short commands, but any Spanish sentence could be whistled.&#8217; Silbo has proved particularly useful when fires have occurred on the island and rapid communication across large areas has been vital.</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>The study team used neuroimaging equipment to contrast the brain activity of silbadores while listening to whistled and spoken Spanish. Results showed the left temporal lobe of the brain, which is usually associated with spoken language, was engaged during the processing of Silbo. The researchers found that other key regions in the brain&#8217;s frontal lobe also responded to the whistles, including those activated in response to sign language among deaf people. When the experiments were repeated with non-whistlers, however, activation was observed in all areas of the brain.</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>&#8216;Our results provide more evidence about the flexibility of human capacity for language in a variety of forms,&#8217; Corina says. &#8216;These data suggest that left-hemisphere language regions are uniquely adapted for communicative purposes, independent of the modality of signal. The non- Silbo speakers were not recognising Silbo as a language. They had nothing to grab onto, so multiple areas of their brains were activated.&#8217;</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>Carreiras says the origins of Silbo Gomero remain obscure, but that indigenous Canary Islanders, who were of North African origin, already had a whistled language when Spain conquered the volcanic islands in the 15th century. Whistled languages survive today in Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Vietnam, Guyana, China, Nepal, Senegal, and a few mountainous pockets in southern Europe. There are thought to be as many as 70 whistled languages still in use, though only 12 have been described and studied scientifically. This form of communication is an adaptation found among cultures where people are often isolated from each other, according to Julien Meyer, a researcher at the Institute of Human Sciences in Lyon, France. &#8216;They are mostly used in mountains or dense forests,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Whistled languages are quite clearly defined and represent an original adaptation of the spoken language for the needs of isolated human groups.&#8217;</span><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"2\"><span>But with modern communication technology now widely available, researchers say whistled languages like Silbo are threatened with extinction. With dwindling numbers of Gomera islanders still fluent in the language, Canaries&#8217; authorities are taking steps to try to ensure its survival. Since 1999, Silbo Gomero has been taught in all of the island&#8217;s elementary schools. In addition, locals are seeking assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). &#8216;The local authorities are trying to get an award from the organisation to declare [Silbo Gomero] as something that should be preserved for humanity,&#8217; Carreiras adds.</span><br></font></span></div>",

Depending on the circumstances, a business may maximize the amount of money it makes, at least in the short term, by damaging the environment and hurting people. That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas, and for international logging companies with short-term leases on tropical rainforest land in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners. When government regulation is effective, and when the public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean big businesses may out-compete dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if government regulation is ineffective and if the public doesn&#8217;t care.</span></font><br></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span>It is easy for the rest of us to blame a business for helping itself by hurting other people. But blaming alone is unlikely to produce change. It ignores the fact that businesses are not charities but profit-making companies, and that publicly owned companies with shareholders are under obligation to those shareholders to maximize profits, provided that they do so by legal means. US laws make a company&#8217;s directors legally liable for something termed &#8216;breach of fiduciary responsibility&#8217; if they knowingly manage a company in a way that reduces profits. The car manufacturer Henry Ford was in fact successfully sued by shareholders in 1919 for raising the minimum wage of his workers to 5$&#160; per day: the courts declared that, while Ford&#8217;s humanitarian sentiments about his employees were nice, his business existed to make profits for its stockholders.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span>Our blaming of businesses also ignores the ultimate responsibility of the public for creating the conditions that let a business profit through destructive environmental policies. In the long run, it is the public, either directly or through its politicians, that has the power to make such destructive policies unprofitable and illegal, and to make sustainable environmental policies profitable.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span>The public can do that by suing businesses for harming them, as happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster, in which over 40,000 m3 of oil were spilled off the coast of Alaska. The public may also make their opinion felt by preferring to buy sustainably harvested products; by making employees of companies with poor track records feel ashamed of their company and complain to their own management; by preferring their governments to award valuable contracts to businesses with a good environmental track record; and by pressing their governments to pass and enforce laws and regulations requiring good environmental practices.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span>In turn, big businesses can exert powerful pressure on any suppliers that might ignore public or government pressure. For instance, after the US public became concerned about the spread of a disease known as BSE, which was transmitted to humans through infected meat, the US government&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration introduced rules demanding that the meat industry abandon practices associated with the risk of the disease spreading. But for five years the meat packers refused to follow these, claiming that they would be too expensive to obey. However, when a major fast-food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its hamburgers plummeted, the meat industry complied within weeks. The public&#8217;s task is therefore to identify which links in the supply chain are sensitive to public pressure: for instance, fast-food chains or jewelry stores, but not meat packers or gold miners.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span>Some readers may be disappointed or outraged that I place the ultimate reSponsibility for business practices harming the public on the public itself. I also believe that the public must accept the necessity for higher prices for products to cover the added costs, if any, of sound environmental practices. My views may seem to ignore the belief that businesses should act in accordance with moral principles even if this leads to a reduction in their profits. But I think we have to recognize that, throughout human history, in all politically complex human societies, government regulation has arisen precisely because it was found that not only did moral principles need to be made explicit, they also needed to be enforced.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font><font size=\"2\"><div>To me, the conclusion that the public has the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful, rather than disappointing. My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. In the past, businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn&#8217;t want. I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses&#8217; environmental practices.</div><div><br></div></font></font></span></div>",

        "content": "<span><b>The Wolf in Europe</b></span><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b><div><span>Wolves once existed throughout much of Europe. However, conflicts with humans and fears originating from religious beliefs, myths and folklore influenced human attitudes towards wolves and, as a result, they have been persecuted for hundreds of years. The wolf has created the most controversy of any predator in Europe, as it occupies conflicting places in people&#8217;s imaginations, being simultaneously loved and hated. On one hand, it is held up as a symbol of wilderness, while for others, wolves symbolise waste and wanton destruction. As a result, wolf conservation is almost always a difficult matter.</span><br></div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Originally, the wolf was one of the world&#8217;s most widely distributed large mammals. It has become extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the USA, and their present distribution is more restricted; wolves occur primarily but not exclusively in remote areas. Their original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third by deliberate persecution due to attacks on livestock and fear of attacks on humans. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes and rural human population shifts to cities have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonisation in parts of its range and reintroduction. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock and game species, exaggerated concern by the public regarding the threat and danger of wolves, and fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with enduring viability.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Historically, wolves have been heavily persecuted in Europe for millennia, and were exterminated from most of northern and western Europe in the last two centuries, probably reaching their minimum in the 1940&#8217;s to 1960&#8217;s. Since then, many populations have begun to recover and expand their range, for example in Spain and Italy. Furthermore, in the last twenty years, the species has been recovering naturally and reappearing in areas from which they had become extinct, for example in France, northern Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland. This recovery has revealed their remarkable ecological adaptability, enabling them to survive in extremely diverse environments. Wolves can basically survive anywhere they can find a source of food, and this can be of various forms, from wild animals, to livestock, to garbage. The only limiting factor seems to be human persecution. As a result, the conservation of wolves is less of an ecological issue and more a social issue, strictly linked to the diverse cultural and socio-economic conditions of the areas they inhabit. This makes international legislation extremely hard to enforce in highly diverse European countries. This is a particularly sensitive issue when it comes to the conservation and management of wolf populations that are transboundary in nature, occupying territories belonging to different countries, and thus requiring international collaboration. In addition, the present distribution of wolves around Europe is extremely uneven and densities vary greatly from country to country. The situation is made even more difficult by the lack of population data across different countries.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Human acceptance of wolves is a major problem in many areas, especially in areas where wolves have returned after an absence and it is important to not underestimate these conflicts, or to believe that they are only linked to livestock. Understanding the reasons why acceptance varies so much between countries could be important for finding solutions. As a result of humans&#8217; attitude to wolves, human- caused mortality, either through hunter harvest, official lethal control, or poaching, is the main limiting factor for wolf populations. There are several countries where wolf management is clearly unsustainable due to over-harvest and even state sanctioned bounty programs within Europe. On the other hand, properly regulated wolf harvest and control appears to be compatible with wolf conservation in many countries. In many cases, it may be a prerequisite for public acceptance by allowing countries to keep wolf populations at a level that is socially acceptable. Countries within Europe have used many different legal mechanisms to maintain management flexibility with respect to being able to kill wolves, using exceptions, derogations or various interpretations of convention definitions.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Poaching is a widespread problem in many countries with very diverse socio-economic backgrounds and it occurs because of the aforementioned fears, but also for pure sport. There is a clear need for effective education and law enforcement throughout wolf range. The sometimes chronic lack of control over poaching greatly reduces management flexibility through legal means, because of the need to account for this uncertainty.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Another issue facing wolves in Europe is a lack of natural prey. Population sizes of the wolf&#8217;s usual prey, such as large grazing mammals (i.e. deer, wild boar and wild goat) have undergone a remarkable reduction over the last decades due to overhunting, habitat loss (usually deforestation) and fragmentation, and grazing competition between domestic and wild herbivores. It has been proved that there is a strong correlation between prey and carnivore abundance &#8211; approximately 10 000 kilograms of prey supports about 90 kilograms of large carnivore biomass, regardless of species. When sufficient prey is unavailable, large carnivore populations will decline, possibly becoming locally extinct. In the case of the wolf in Europe, this problem can be compounded by wolf conflicts with livestock, which increase as the wolves search for alternative food sources. Similarly, when wolves are forced to range more widely in search of prey, they may face greater exposure to human-related threats, including mortality on roads and direct persecution in regions with high human population densities.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div>",

It has been predicted that two-thirds of the world&#8217;s</span></div><div><span>inhabitants could live in water-stressed conditions by 2025, and this will be exacerbated by the</span></div><div><span>demands of the increasing numbers of people needing water, increasing numbers of bigger towns,</span></div><div><span>and climate change.</span></div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Without improved sanitation and sustainable supplies of water of sufficient quantity and quality, many countries will suffer from increased poverty and disease, food and energy insecurity and economic dislocations. These problems have the potential to undermine economic development, exacerbate migration pressures, increase civil unrest, reduce trade and export opportunities, and prevent countries from advancing policies and programs. Safe water is fundamental to solving challenges to human health, economic development, and peace and security. Water problems are unfortunately difficult to solve and the needy and weak, in particular women and girls, can be the most difficult to improve the lot of in many societies.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Drinking water supplies are safest in the developed world. However, even the safest drinking water sources can suffer adulteration, causing sickness and disease from waterborne germs and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing agents. Public drinking water systems use various methods of treatment to provide safe drinking water for their communities. Today, the most common steps in water treatment used by community water systems are uniform in most developed countries.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Coagulation and flocculation are the first two steps in water treatment. Positively-charged chemicals are added to the water and these neutralise the negative charge of dirt and other dissolved particles in the water. When this occurs, the particles bind with the chemicals and form larger particles, called floc. During the next step, floc settles to the bottom of the water supply, due to its weight. This process involves the settling of other solids and is called sedimentation. Once the solids have settled to the bottom, the clear water on top will go through to the next stage to go through filters of varying pore sixes and different compositions, such as sand, gravel, and charcoal, and pore sizes, in order to remove dissolved particles, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. After the water has been filtered, disinfection is performed to kill any remaining parasites, bacteria, and viruses. The water is then stored until it is piped to homes and businesses.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Water may be treated differently in different communities depending on the quality of the water entering the treatment plant. Typically, surface water requires more treatment and filtration than ground water, because lakes, rivers, and streams hold more earth and pollutants and are more likely to be contaminated.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Even though most countries set standards for public drinking water, many people use a home water treatment. Household water treatment systems are composed of two categories: point-of-use and point-of-entry. Point-of-entry systems are typically installed after the water meter and treat most of the water entering a residence. Point-of-use systems are systems that treat water in batches and deliver water to a tap, such as a kitchen or bathroom sink or an auxiliary faucet mounted next to a tap. The most common types of household water treatment systems might consist of four components. The first is a filtration system, which is a device that removes impurities from water by means of a physical barrier, chemical, and/or biological process. The second is a water softener, which is a device that reduces the hardness of the water. A water softener typically uses sodium or potassium ions to replace calcium and magnesium ions. The third is a distillation system, which executes a process in which impure water is boiled and the steam is collected and condensed in a separate container, leaving many of the solid contaminants behind. The fourth is disinfection, which is a physical or chemical process in which pathogenic microorganisms are deactivated or killed. Examples of chemical disinfectants are chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone. Examples of physical disinfectants include ultraviolet light, electronic radiation, and heat.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Another treatment that public water is subjected to is fluoridation. For example, people in the United States have benefited for 70 years from drinking water with fluoride, leading to better dental health. Drinking fluoridated water keeps teeth strong and reduces tooth decay by about 25 per cent in children and adults. By preventing cavities, community water fluoridation has been shown to save money for families and for the US health care system. Oral health in the United States is much better today than it was many years ago; however, cavities are still one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Community water fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to deliver fluoride to people of all ages, education levels, and income levels who live in a community. Most water has some fluoride, but usually not enough to prevent cavities, but community water systems can add the right amount of fluoride to the local drinking water to prevent them. This has led to community water fluoridation being regarded as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th Century. Some bottled waters do not have fluoride put in as an ingredient, and some do. Fluoride can occur naturally in source waters used for bottling or be added, but most bottled waters contain fluoride at levels that are less than optimal for good oral health.</span><br></div>",

Beauty pageants have also long been part of American popular culture. The Miss America Pageant is the most well-known and it was started in 1921 as a &#8216;bathing beauty&#8217; contest to entice summer holidaymakers to stay in town past Labor Day. Local newsman Herb Test created history by offering to title the girl who won &#8216;Miss America.&#8217; Out of the eight competitors for the title, Margaret Gorman, who represented the nation&#8217;s capital as Miss Washington D.C., was declared the beauty queen, winning the first-ever Miss America title. For several years afterward, the contest was dogged by controversies. First, the contest came under criticism of corruption and bias. Then, 15-year-old Marian Bergeron won the crown. When her age was discovered, she was disqualified, but the crown had already been stolen from her hotel.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph B&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>In 1935, the pageant was revived by producer Lenora Slaughter. By this time, the nation was in the grip of Hollywood fever. Pageant-winners were often offered Hollywood screen tests, and film producers from Hollywood started scouring these contests for potential stars of the silver screen. Some women actually did make it to the screen that way, including Dorothy Lamour, who went on to co-star in several successful movies. It was only in 1938 that a skills component became mandatory for the pageant. Slaughter also decided to offer a college scholarship to the winner, the then significant sum of $5,000. In 1948, history was made again when Slaughter announced that henceforth the winners would be crowned in evening gowns only.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph C&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>As times changed, though, so have beauty pageants. Today, this annual U.S. national competition, as well as state and local pageants, claim to showcase the talent, intellect, and beauty of modern women. The pageants provide popular entertainment for those at the competitions and, through the broadcast media, to those watching at home. Funds for sponsoring the pageants and providing the prizes are traditionally drawn from individuals, small businesses, corporations, civic groups, foundations, and universities. Commercial sponsors reap favourable promotion opportunities, leading to increased product visibility and market share. Prizes include the coveted crown, and may also include trophies, vacations, clothes, jewelry, savings bonds, and cash. Besides prizes, the winner has the opportunity to pursue her career and community service goals, as well as the obligation to represent the pageant sponsors&#8217; commercial interests.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph D&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>Beauty contests have various advantages for the contestants. Firstly, in order to compete and be successful in the beauty pageant world, contestants have to have a pretty significant amount of self- discipline. They have to train so that they are perfect on stage, keep a strict diet and workout regime in place, and put in the work to make themselves look their best. This quality is a skill that can help participants in many different aspects of life, especially if they begin competing at a young age. Secondly, contestants have to be well-rounded people in order to succeed in the pageant world. It isn&#8217;t all about looking pretty and wearing fancy clothes. They also have to be prepared to answer insightful questions and be able to handle themselves under pressure. These are skills that are needed to be successful, not only in the pageant world, but in real life as well. Thirdly, although some beauty pageants are just about winning the contest, others have some real advantages to participating. Many pageants offer cash rewards for the winner, and pageants for younger girls often give out college scholarships. This is an advantage, because it helps these young people to begin to prepare for their future, and gets them in the mindset of self-improvement. Finally, the pageant world is an interconnected community of parents, participants, and trainers. When people compete in many pageants, they begin to develop bonds with the people that they are competing with on a regular basis. These are friendships that will likely last for a long time.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph E&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>The disadvantages of beauty contests are wide-ranging. Firstly, beauty pageants are for the beautiful. This is harmful to young girls and even adults who feel they cannot compete. The strong focus on physical appearance can cause competing girls to form obsessions, and a loss gives the feeling that they were not pretty enough to win. In addition, beauty pageants also tacitly approve of the ideology for both men and women that women should only be evaluated by their personal appearance. Secondly, the winners of the big name pageants of the past all have one thing in common: they are thin. This simple fact creates a norm for girls who compete in pageants to live up to. The result is a group of competing young girls within which eating disorders and depression run rampant. Eating disorders are extremely unhealthy, and can cause irreversible damage to girls&#8217; bodies. The resulting depression can naturally lead to severe problems as well. Finally, exploitation is a common word heard with regards to beauty pageants. In child pageants, which are rapidly growing in popularity around the world, the children are taken advantage of because they often have no say as to whether or not they compete.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><div><span><b>Paragraph F&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>Pageant organisers would counter the above arguments by maintaining that the contests offer substantial benefits to the contestants and sponsors and provide a forum to showcase community customs and traditions. The organisers claim that pageants can therefore promote the growth and development of the community, which substantially benefits the said community as a whole. Pageants also offer a recreational outlet for participants and community members.</span><br></div></div>",

Concrete is the second most used substance in the global economy, after water &#8211; and one of the world&#8217;s biggest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The chemical process by which cement, the key ingredient of concrete, is created results in large quantities of carbon dioxide. The UN estimates that there will be 9.8 billion people living on the planet by mid-century. They will need somewhere to live. If concrete is the only answer to the construction of new cities, then carbon emissions will soar, aggravating global warming. And so scientists have started innovating with other materials, in a scramble for alternatives to a universal commodity that has underpinned our modem life for many years.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>B</b>. The problem with replacing concrete is that it is so very good at what it does. Chris Cheeseman, an engineering professor at Imperial College London, says the key thing to consider is the extent to which concrete is used around the world, and is likely to continue to be used. &#8216;Concrete is not a high-carbon product. Cement is high carbon, but concrete is not. But it is the scale on which it is used that makes it high carbon. The sheer scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the issue.&#8217;</span><br><span><b>C</b>. Not only are the ingredients of concrete relatively cheap and found in abundance in most places around the globe, the stuff itself has marvellous properties: Portland cement, the vital component of concrete, is mouldable and pourable, but quickly sets hard. Cheeseman also notes another advantage: concrete and steel have similar thermal expansion properties, so steel can be used to reinforce concrete, making it far stronger and more flexible as a building material than it could be on its own. According to Cheeseman, all these factors together make concrete hard to beat. &#8216;Concrete is amazing stuff. Making anything with similar properties is going to be very difficult.&#8217;</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>D</b>. A possible alternative to concrete is wood. Making buildings from wood may seem like a rather medieval idea, but climate change is driving architects to turn to treated timber as a possible resource. Recent years have seen the emergence of tall buildings constructed almost entirely from timber. Vancouver, Vienna and Brumunddal in Norway are all home to constructed tall, wooden buildings.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>E</b>. Using wood to construct buildings, however, is not straightforward. Wood expands as it absorbs moisture from the air and is susceptible to pests, not to mention fire. But treating wood and combining it with other materials can improve its properties. Cross-laminated timber is engineered wood. An adhesive is used to stick layers of solid-sawn timber together, crosswise, to form building blocks. This material is light but has the strength of concrete and steel. Construction experts say that wooden buildings can be constructed at a greater speed than ones of concrete and steel and the process, it seems, is quieter.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>F</b>. Stora Enso is Europe&#8217;s biggest supplier of cross-laminated timber, and its vice-president Markus Mannstrom reports that the company is seeing increasing demand globally for building in wood, with climate change concerns the key driver. Finland, with its large forests, where Stora Enso is based, has been leading the way, but the company is seeing a rise in demand for its timber products across the world, including in Asia. Of course, using timber in a building also locks away the carbon that it absorbed as it grew. But even treated wood has its limitations and only when a wider range of construction projects has been proven in practice will it be possible to see wood as a real alternative to concrete in constructing tall buildings.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>G</b>. Fly ash and slag from iron ore are possible alternatives to cement in a concrete mix. Fly ash, a byproduct of coal-burning power plants, can be incorporated into concrete mixes to make up as much as 15 to 30% of the cement, without harming the strength or durability of the resulting mix. Iron-ore slag, a byproduct of the iron-ore smelting process, can be used in a similar way. Their incorporation into concrete mixes has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</span></div><div><span><br></span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>But Anna Surgenor, of the UK&#8217;s Green Building Council, notes that although these waste products can save carbon in the concrete mix, their use is not always straightforward. &#8216;It&#8217;s possible to replace the cement content in concrete with waste products to lower the overall carbon impact. But there are several calculations that need to be considered across the entire life cycle of the building- these include factoring in where these materials are being shipped from. If they are transported over long distances, using fossil fuels, the use of alternative materials might not make sense from an overall carbon reduction perspective.&#8217;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b><br></b></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>H.</b> </span><span>While these technologies are all promising ideas, they are either unproven or based on materials that are not abundant. In their overview of innovation in the concrete industry, Felix Preston and Johanna Lehne of the UK&#8217;s Royal Institute of International Affairs reached the conclusion that, &#8216;Some novel cements have been discussed for more than a decade within the research community, without breaking through. At present, these alternatives are rarely as cost-effective as conventional cement, and they face raw-material shortages and resistance from customers.&#8217;</span></p></div></span>",

Steam had already enjoyed a long and successful career in the railways, so it was only natural that the technology evolved into a miniaturized version which was separate from the trains. But these early cars inherited steam&#8217;s weaknesses along with its strengths. The boilers had to be lit by hand, and they required about twenty minutes to build up pressure before they could be driven. Furthermore, their water reservoirs only lasted for about thirty miles before needing replenishment. Despite such shortcomings, these newly designed self-propelled carriages offered quick transportation, and by the early 1900s it was not uncommon to see such machines shuttling wealthy citizens around town.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b> But the glory days of steam cars were few. A new technology called the Internal Combustion Engine soon appeared, which offered the ability to drive down the road just moments after starting up. At first, these noisy gasoline cars were unpopular because they were more complicated to operate and they had difficult hand-crank starters, which were known to break arms when the engines backfired. But in 1912 General Motors introduced the electric starter, and over the following few years steam power was gradually phased out.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b>. Even as the market was declining, four brothers made one last effort to rekindle the technology. Between 1906 and 1909, while still attending high school, Abner Doble and his three brothers built their first steam car in their parents&#8217; basement. It comprised parts taken from a wrecked early steam car but reconfigured to drive an engine of their own design. Though it did not run well, the Doble brothers went on to build a second and third prototype in the following years. Though the Doble boys&#8217; third prototype, nicknamed the Model B, still lacked the convenience of an internal combustion engine, it drew the attention of automobile trade magazines due to its numerous improvements over previous steam cars. The Model B proved to be superior to gasoline automobiles in many ways. Its high-pressure steam drove the engine pistons in virtual silence, in contrast to clattering gas engines which emitted the aroma of burned hydrocarbons. Perhaps most impressively, the Model B was amazingly swift. It could accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in just fifteen seconds, a feat described as &#8216;remarkable acceleration&#8217; by Automobile magazine in 1914.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.</b> The following year Abner Doble drove the Model B from Massachusetts to Detroit in order to seek investment in his automobile design, which he used to open the General Engineering Company. He and his brothers immediately began working on the Model C, which was intended to expand upon the innovations of the Model B. The brothers added features such as a key-based ignition in the cabin, eliminating the need for the operator to manually ignite the boiler. With these enhancements, the Dobles&#8217; new car company promised a steam vehicle which would provide all of the convenience of a gasoline car, but with much greater speed, much simpler driving controls, and a virtually silent powerplant. By the following April, the General Engineering Company had received 5,390 deposits for Doble Detroits, which were scheduled for delivery in early 1918.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b> Later that year Abner Doble delivered unhappy news to those eagerly awaiting the delivery of their modern new cars. Those buyers who received the handful of completed cars complained that the vehicles were sluggish and erratic, sometimes going in reverse when they should go forward. The new engine design, though innovative, was still plagued with serious glitches.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F. </b>The brothers made one final attempt to produce a viable steam automobile. In early 1924, the Doble brothers shipped a Model E to New York City to be road-tested by the Automobile Club of America. After sitting overnight in freezing temperatures, the car was pushed out into the road and left to sit for over an hour in the frosty morning air. At the turn of the key, the boiler lit and reached its operating pressure inside of forty seconds. As they drove the test vehicle further, they found that its evenly distributed weight lent it surprisingly good handling, even though it was so heavy. As the new Doble steamer was further developed and tested, its maximum speed was pushed to over a hundred miles per hour, and it achieved about fifteen miles per gallon of kerosene with negligible emissions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.</b> Sadly, the Dobles&#8217; brilliant steam car never was a financial success. Priced at around $18,000 in 1924, it was popular only among the very wealthy. Plus, it is said that no two Model Es were quite the same, because Abner Doble tinkered endlessly with the design. By the time the company folded in 1931, fewer than fifty of the amazing Model E steam cars had been produced. For his whole career, until his death in 1961, Abner Doble remained adamant that steam-powered automobiles were at least equal to gasoline cars, if not superior. Given the evidence, he may have been right. Many of the Model E Dobles which have survived are still in good working condition, some having been driven over half a million miles with only normal maintenance. Astonishingly, an unmodified Doble Model E runs clean enough to pass the emissions laws in California today, and they are pretty strict. It is true that the technology poses some difficult problems, but you cannot help but wonder how efficient a steam car might be with the benefit of modern materials and computers. Under the current pressure to improve automotive performance and reduce emissions, it is not unthinkable that the steam car may rise again.</div><div><br></div></div></div>",

It&#8217;s an English literature lesson in a UK school, and the teacher has just read an extract from Shakespeare&#8217;s Romeo and Juliet with a class of 15-year-olds. He&#8217;s given some of the students copies of No Fear Shakespeare, a kid-friendly translation of the original. For three students, even these literacy demands are beyond them. Another girl simply can&#8217;t focus and he gives her pens and paper to draw with. The teacher can ask the No Fear group to identify the key characters and maybe provide a tentative plot summary. He can ask most of the class about character development, and five of them might be able to support their statements with textual evidence. Now two curious students are wondering whether Shakespeare advocates living a life of moderation or one of passionate engagement.</div><div><br></div><div>As a teacher myself, I&#8217;d think my lesson would be going rather well if the discussion went as described above. But wouldn&#8217;t this kind of class work better if there weren&#8217;t such a huge gap between the top and the bottom? If we put all the kids who needed literacy support into one class, and all the students who want to discuss the virtue of moderation into another?</div><div><br></div><div>The practice of &#8216;streaming&#8217;, or &#8216;tracking&#8217;, involves separating students into classes depending on their diagnosed levels of attainment. At a macro level, it requires the establishment of academically selective schools for the brightest students, and comprehensive schools for the rest. Within schools, it means selecting students into a &#8216;stream&#8217; of general ability, or &#8216;sets&#8217; of subject-specific ability. The practice is intuitively appealing to almost every stakeholder.</div><div><br></div><div>I have heard the mixed-ability model attacked by way of analogy: a group hike. The fittest in the group take the lead and set a brisk pace, only to have to stop and wait every 20 minutes. This is frustrating, and their enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, the slowest ones are not only embarrassed but physically struggling to keep up. What&#8217;s worse, they never get a long enough break. They honestly just want to quit. Hiking, they feel, is not for them.</div><div><br></div><div>Mixed-ability classes bore students, frustrate parents and bum out teachers. The brightest ones will never summit Mount Qomolangma, and the stragglers won&#8217;t enjoy the lovely stroll in the park they are perhaps more suited to. Individuals suffer at the demands of the collective, mediocrity prevails. So: is learning like hiking?</div><div><br></div><div>The current pedagogical paradigm is arguably that of constructivism, which emerged out of the work of psychologist Lev Vygotsky. In the 1930s, Vygotsky emphasised the importance of targeting a student&#8217;s specific &#8216;zone of proximal development&#8217; (ZPD). This is the gap between what they can achieve only with support &#8211; teachers, textbooks, worked examples, parents and so on &#8211; and what they can achieve independently. The purpose of teaching is to provide and then gradually remove this &#8216;scaffolding&#8217; until they are autonomous. If we accept this model, it follows that streaming students with similar ZPDs would be an efficient and effective solution. And that forcing everyone on the same hike &#8211; regardless of aptitude &#8211; would be madness.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite all this, there is limited empirical evidence to suggest that streaming results in better outcomes for students. Professor John Hattie, director of the Melbourne Education Research Institute, notes that &#8216;tracking has minimal effects on learning outcomes&#8217;. What is more, streaming appears to significantly &#8211; and negatively &#8211; affect those students assigned to the lowest sets. These students tend to have much higher representation of low socio economic class. Less significant is the small benefit for those lucky clever students in the higher sets. The overall result is that the smart stay smart and the dumb get dumber, further entrenching the social divide.</div><div><br></div><div>In the latest update of Hattie&#8217;s influential meta-analysis of factors influencing student achievement, one of the most significant factors is the teachers&#8217; estimate of achievement. Streaming students by diagnosed achievement automatically limits what the teacher feels the student is capable of. Meanwhile, in a mixed environment, teachers&#8217; estimates need to be more diverse and flexible.</div><div>While streaming might seem to help teachers effectively target a student&#8217;s ZPD, it can underestimate the importance of peer-to-peer learning. A crucial aspect of constructivist theory is the role of the MKO &#8211; &#8216;more knowledgeable other&#8217; &#8211; in knowledge construction. While teachers are traditionally the MKOs in classrooms, the value of knowledgeable student peers must not go unrecognised either.</div><div><br></div><div>I find it amazing to watch students get over an idea to their peers in ways that I would never think of. They operate with different language tools and different social tools from teachers and, having just learnt it themselves, they possess similar cognitive structures to their struggling classmates. There is also something exciting about passing on skills and knowledge that you yourself have just mastered &#8211; a certain pride and zeal, a certain freshness to the interaction between &#8216;teacher&#8217; and &#8216;learner&#8217; that is often lost by the expert for whom the steps are obvious and the joy of discovery forgotten.</div><div><br></div><div>Having a variety of different abilities in a collaborative learning environment provides valuable resources for helping students meet their learning needs, not to mention improving their communication and social skills. And today, more than ever, we need the many to flourish &#8211; not suffer at the expense of a few bright stars. Once a year, I go on a hike with my class, a mixed bunch of students. It is challenging. The fittest students realise they need to encourage the reluctant. There are lookouts who report back, and extra items to carry for others. We make it &#8211; together.</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><span><b>Green roofs</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A.</b> Rooftops covered with grass, vegetable gardens and lush foliage are now a common sight in many cities around the world. More and more private companies and city authorities are investing in green roofs, drawn to their wide-ranging benefits. Among the benefits are saving on energy costs, mitigating the risk of floods, making habitats for urban wildlife, tackling air pollution and even growing food. These increasingly radical urban designs can help cities adapt to the monumental problems they face, such as access to resources and a lack of green space due to development. But the involvement of city authorities, businesses and other institutions is crucial to ensuring their success &#8211; as is research investigating different options to suit the variety of rooftop spaces found in cities. The UK is relatively new to developing green roofs, and local governments and institutions are playing a major role in spreading the practice. London is home to much of the UK&#8217;s green roof market, mainly due to forward-thinking policies such as the London Plan, which has paved the way to more than doubling the area of green roofs in the capital.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>B.</b>&#160;</span></span><span>Ongoing research is showcasing how green roofs in cities can integrate with &#8216;living walls&#8217;: environmentally friendly walls which are partially or completely covered with greenery, including a growing medium, such as soil or water. Research also indicates that green roofs can be integrated with drainage systems on the ground, such as street trees, so that the water is managed better and the built environment is made more sustainable. There is also evidence to demonstrate the social value of green roofs. Doctors are increasingly prescribing time spent gardening outdoors for patients dealing with anxiety and depression. And research has found that access to even the most basic green spaces can provide a better quality of life for dementia sufferers and help people avoid obesity.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>C.</b>&#160;</span><span>In North America, green roofs have become mainstream, with a wide array of expansive, accessible and food-producing roofs installed in buildings. Again, city leaders and authorities have helped push the movement forward &#8211; only recently, San Francisco, USA, created a policy requiring new buildings to have green roofs. Toronto, Canada, has policies dating from the 1990s, encouraging the development of urban farms on rooftops. These countries also benefit from having newer buildings than in many parts of the world, which makes it easier to install green roofs. Being able to keep enough water at roof height and distribute it right across the rooftop is crucial to maintaining the plants on any green roof &#8211; especially on &#8216;edible roofs&#8217; where fruit and vegetables are farmed. And it&#8217;s much easier to do this in newer buildings, which can typically hold greater weight, than to retro-fit old ones. Having a stronger roof also makes it easier to grow a greater variety of plants, since the soil can be deeper.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>D.</b>&#160;</span><span>For green roofs to become the norm for new developments, there needs to be support from public authorities and private investors. Those responsible for maintaining buildings may have to acquire new skills, such as landscaping, and in some cases, volunteers may be needed to help out. Other considerations include installing drainage paths, meeting health and safety requirements and perhaps allowing access for the public, as well as planning restrictions and disruption from regular activities in and around the buildings during installation. To convince investors and developers that installing green roofs is worthwhile, economic arguments are still the most important. The term &#8216;natural capital&#8217; has been developed to explain the economic value of nature; for example, measuring the money saved by installing natural solutions to protect against flood damage, adapt to climate change or help people lead healthier and happier lives.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>E.&#160;</b></span><span>As the expertise about green roofs grows, official standards have been developed to ensure that they are designed, constructed and maintained properly, and function well. Improvements in the science and technology underpinning green roof development have also led to new variations in the concept. For example, &#8216;blue roofs&#8217; enable buildings to hold water over longer periods of time, rather than draining it away quickly &#8211; crucial in times of heavier rainfall. There are also combinations of green roofs with solar panels, and &#8216;brown roofs&#8217; which are wilder in nature and maximise biodiversity. If the trend continues, it could create new jobs and a more vibrant and sustainable local food economy &#8211; alongside many other benefits. There are still barriers to overcome, but the evidence so far indicates that green roofs have the potential to transform cities and help them function sustainably long into the future. The success stories need to be studied and replicated elsewhere, to make green, blue, brown and food-producing roofs the norm in cities around the world.</span></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>The growth mindset</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><span>Over the past century, a powerful idea has taken root in the educational landscape. The concept of intelligence as something innate has been supplanted by the idea that intelligence is not fixed, and that, with the right training, we can be the authors of our own cognitive capabilities. Psychologist Alfred Binet, the developer of the first intelligence tests, was one of many 19th-century scientists who held that earlier view and sought to quantify cognitive ability. Then, in the early 20th century, progressive thinkers revolted against the notion that inherent ability is destiny. Instead, educators such as John Dewey argued that every child&#8217;s intelligence could be developed, given the right environment.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#8216;Growth mindset theory&#8217; is a relatively new &#8211; and extremely popular &#8211; version of this idea. In many schools today you will see hallways covered in motivational posters and hear speeches on the mindset of great sporting heroes who simply believed their way to the top. A major focus of the growth mindset in schools is coaxing students away from seeing failure as an indication of their ability, and towards seeing it as a chance to improve that ability. As educationalist Jeff Howard noted several decades ago: &#8216;Smart is not something that you just are, smart is something that you can get.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The idea of the growth mindset is based on the work of psychologist Carol Dweck in California in the 1990s. In one key experiment, Dweck divided a group of 10- to 12-year-olds into two groups. All were told that they had achieved a high score on a test but the first group were praised for their intelligence in achieving this, while the others were praised for their effort. The second group &#8211; those who had been instilled with a &#8216;growth mindset&#8217; &#8211; were subsequently far more likely to put effort into future tasks. Meanwhile, the former took on only those tasks that would not risk their sense of worth. This group had inferred that success or failure is due to innate ability, and this &#8216;fixed mindset&#8217; had led them to fear of failure and lack of effort. Praising ability actually made the students perform worse, while praising effort emphasised that change was possible.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>One of the greatest impediments to successfully implementing a growth mindset, however, is the education system itself: in many parts of the world, the school climate is obsessed with performance in the form of constant testing, analysing and ranking of students &#8211; a key characteristic of the fixed mindset. Nor is it unusual for schools to create a certain cognitive dissonance, when they applaud the benefits of a growth mindset but then hand out fixed target grades in lessons based on performance.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Aside from the implementation problem, the original growth mindset research has also received harsh criticism. The statistician Andrew Gelman claims that &#8216;their research designs have enough degrees of freedom that they could take their data to support just about any theory at all&#8217;. Professor of Psychology Timothy Bates, who has been trying to replicate Dweck&#8217;s work, is finding that the results are repeatedly null. He notes that: &#8216;People with a growth mindset don&#8217;t cope any better with failure &#8230; Kids with the growth mindset aren&#8217;t getting better grades, either before or after our intervention study.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Much of this criticism is not lost on Dweck, and she deserves great credit for responding to it and adapting her work accordingly. In fact, she argues that her work has been misunderstood and misapplied in a range of ways. She has also expressed concerns that her theories are being misappropriated in schools by being conflated with the self-esteem movement: &#8216;For me the growth mindset is a tool for learning and improvement. It&#8217;s not just a vehicle for making children feel good.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>But there is another factor at work here. The failure to translate the growth mindset into the classroom might reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of teaching and learning itself. Growth mindset supporters David Yeager and Gregory Walton claim that interventions should be delivered in a subtle way to maximise their effectiveness. They say that if adolescents perceive a teacher&#8217;s intervention as conveying that they are in need of help, this could undo its intended effects.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>A lot of what drives students is their innate beliefs and how they perceive themselves. There is a strong correlation between self-perception and achievement, but there is evidence to suggest that the actual effect of achievement on self-perception is stronger than the other way round. To stand up in a classroom and successfully deliver a good speech is a genuine achievement, and that is likely to be more powerfully motivating than vague notions of &#8216;motivation&#8217; itself.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Recent evidence would suggest that growth mindset interventions are not the elixir of student learning that its proponents claim it to be. The growth mindset appears to be a viable construct in the lab, which, when administered in the classroom via targeted interventions, doesn&#8217;t seem to work. It is hard to dispute that having faith in the capacity to change is a good attribute for students. Paradoxically, however, that aspiration is not well served by direct interventions that try to instil it.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Motivational posters and talks are often a waste of time, and might well give students a deluded notion of what success actually means. Teaching concrete skills such as how to write an effective introduction to an essay then praising students&#8217; effort in getting there is probably a far better way of improving confidence than telling them how unique they are, or indeed how capable they are of changing their own brains. Perhaps growth mindset works best as a philosophy and not an intervention.</span><br></div>",

Wegener proposed this theory in 1912 and developed it extensively for nearly 20 years. His book on the subject, The Origin of Continents and Oceans, went through four editions and was the focus of an international controversy in his lifetime and for some years after his death.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Wegener&#8217;s basic idea was that many mysteries about the Earth&#8217;s history could be solved if one supposed that the continents moved laterally, rather than supposing that they remained fixed in place. Wegener showed in great detail how such continental movements were plausible and how they worked, using evidence from a large number of sciences including geology, geophysics, paleontology, and climatology. Wegener&#8217;s idea &#8211; that the continents move &#8211; is at the heart of the theory that guides Earth sciences today: namely plate tectonics. Plate tectonics is in many respects quite different from Wegener&#8217;s proposal, in the same way that modern evolutionary theory is very different from the ideas Charles Darwin proposed in the 1850s about biological evolution. Yet plate tectonics is a descendant of Alfred Wegener&#8217;s theory of continental drift, in quite the same way that modern evolutionary theory is a descendant of Darwin&#8217;s theory of natural selection.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>When I started writing about Wegener&#8217;s life and work, one of the most intriguing things about him for me was that, although he came up with a theory on continental drift, he was not a geologist. He trained as an astronomer and pursued a career in atmospheric physics. When he proposed the theory of continental displacements in 1912, he was a lecturer in physics and astronomy at the University of Marburg, in southern Germany. However, he was not an &#8216;unknown&#8217;. In 1906 he had set a world record (with his brother Kurt) for time aloft in a hot-air balloon: 52 hours. Between 1906 and 1908 he had taken part in a highly publicized and extremely dangerous expedition to the coast of northeast Greenland. He had also made a name for himself amongst a small circle of meteorologists and atmospheric physicists in Germany as the author of a textbook, Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere (1911), and of a number of interesting scientific papers.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>As important as Wegener&#8217;s work on continental drift has turned out to be, it was largely a sideline to his interest in atmospheric physics, geophysics, and paleoclimatology*, and thus I have been at great pains to put Wegener&#8217;s work on continental drift in the larger context of his other scientific work, and in the even larger context of atmospheric sciences in his lifetime. This is a &#8216;continental drift book&#8217; only to the extent that Wegener was interested in that topic and later became famous for it. My treatment of his other scientific work is no less detailed, though I certainly have devoted more attention to the reception of his ideas on continental displacement, as they were much more controversial than his other work.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Readers interested in the specific detail of Wegener&#8217;s career will see that he often stopped pursuing a given line of investigation (sometimes for years on end), only to pick it up later. I have tried to provide guideposts to his rapidly shifting interests by characterizing different phases of his life as careers in different sciences, which is reflected in the titles of the chapters. Thus, the index should be a sufficient guide for those interested in a particular aspect of Wegener&#8217;s life but perhaps not all of it. My own feeling, however, is that the parts do not make as much sense on their own as do all of his activities taken together. In this respect I urge readers to try to experience Wegener&#8217;s life as he lived it, with all the interruptions, changes of mind, and renewed efforts this entailed.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Wegener left behind a few published works but, as was standard practice, these reported the results of his work &#8211; not the journey he took to reach that point. Only a few hundred of the many thousands of letters he wrote and received in his lifetime have survived and he didn&#8217;t keep notebooks or diaries that recorded his life and activities. He was not active (with a few exceptions) in scientific societies, and did not seek to find influence or advance his ideas through professional contacts and politics, spending most of his time at home in his study reading and writing, or in the field collecting observations.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Some famous scientists, such as Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, left mountains of written material behind, hundreds of notebooks and letters numbering in the tens of thousands. Others, like Michael Faraday, left extensive journals of their thoughts and speculations, parallel to their scientific notebooks. The more such material a scientist leaves behind, the better chance a biographer has of forming an accurate picture of how a scientist&#8217;s ideas took shape and evolved.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div>I am firmly of the opinion that most of us, Wegener included, are not in any real sense the authors of our own lives. We plan, think, and act, often with apparent freedom, but most of the time our lives &#8216;happen to us&#8217;, and we only retrospectively turn this happenstance into a coherent narrative of fulfilled intentions. This book, therefore, is a story both of the life and scientific work that Alfred Wegener planned and intended and of the life and scientific work that actually &#8216;happened to him&#8217;. These are, as I think you will soon see, not always the same thing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>----------</div><div><br></div><div>* Paleoclimatology &#8211; The study of past climates</div>",

        "content": "<b>The oak trees in Britain</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Oak trees, which have a special place in folklore in many parts of Europe, are associated with the gods of thunder and lightning in Greek, Roman and Celtic mythology. This link may in part be due to the towering habit of the oak tree, which has made it susceptible to being struck by lightning, standing out as it does from the surrounding trees.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Among the approximately 60 trees native to Britain are two indigenous species of oak: the English oak (Quercus robur) and the Sessile oak (Quercus petraea), both of which are deciduous and flower in late spring. The former favours fertile lowland soils and the latter less fertile and wetter soils on higher ground.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The English oak, the most common British tree species, represents strength and endurance as reflected in its Latin name. It has been celebrated in folklore and in coinage with the 2012 &#163;5 official coin featuring the leaf and acorn of the oak tree. The species can probably lay claim to being the most famous in Britain, where its leaves are a national symbol. The English oak can grow to a height of 35 metres with a rounded head and spreading habit of up to 30 metres in diameter, while the Sessile oak can grow to a height of 40 metres with a spreading habit of 25 metres. The flowers in both trees are borne in yellow green catkins. The leaves of the English oak have very short stalks and are alternate on the branches, but have long-stalked acorns, held tightly in cupules. The Sessile oak, by comparison, has long-stalked leaves, but short- stalked acorns. The acorns turn from green to brown in autumn and when loosened from the cupules fall to the ground below. Both trees have a grey bark with the English oak having deep vertical fissures, but ridges developing only in mature trees in the case of the Sessile oak.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oak trees can live to more than 200 years with the oldest known, the Pontfadog Oak, a Sessile oak in Wales, being knocked over by winds in 2013. But despite their great age, according to the Woodland Trust in the UK, the oldest British tree, a yew tree known as the Fortingall Yew in Perthshire is considered to be more than 3,000 years old and may be considerably more.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oak trees are invaluable habitats for a wide range of wildlife species with both types of oak being a habitat for more wildlife than other trees native to Britain. More than 250 different species of insects are found in oaks, providing food for other wildlife such as birds. Their bark is an ideal habitat for 300 or more species of lichen that have been found growing there. Their cavities and branches also provide a home for birds and bats and in autumn the ground under the canopy of spreading oak branches provides a rich source of food for a wide variety of insects, such as beetles, and fungi. The 50,000 or more acorns produced by oak trees over their lifetime were once used for making flour for bread, but are now a welcome food for various birds and mammals, including the red squirrel, badger and mice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oak trees have also had some other important uses worth noting. Apart from their use in herbal medicine for the treatment of conditions such as diarrhoea and kidney stones, being a hard wood the timber of oak trees was once used in ship-building, but today its main use is in furniture-making, for floors in buildings, and firewood.<br></div><div><br></div><div>After a serious shortage of timber was identified during the First World War, the UK Forestry Commission was established in 1919 for the expansion and protection of woods in Britain. However, despite new forests being planted and private woodland being regenerated by the Commission, since the 1920s oak trees have been under serious threat. The foliage of the oak trees and their bark have been affected by the oak processionary moth, which is also a health hazard for humans, causing itching and respiratory problems. Two other diseases having an impact on the health of Britain&#8217;s oaks are Acute Oak Decline (AOD) and Chronic Oak Decline (COD), especially in southern and eastern England. The canopy of an affected tree is thinner than normal, the branches die back and black weeping wounds are found on the tree&#8217;s stems.&#160;Britain&#8217;s oak trees are in danger of suffering the same fate as the ancient woodland that once covered Britain and Europe, unless they are given greater protection not only from diseases, but also from the impact of shrinking habits and pollution as the result of the human development.<br></div>",

        "content": "<b>Ice harvested in Norway</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In the days prior to mechanical refrigeration, in many countries with mild climates ice was a prized commodity available only to commercial enterprises and large houses with sufficient facilities for ice production in ponds and for storage. Up to the 1840s, for example, the ice available in London, restricted by the climate, was collected from lakes, and even canals such as the Regent&#8217;s Canal, which runs through central London. The ice, however, was of questionable quality.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As demand grew, ice was shipped from the United States to supply the needs of merchants. That was the case until a Swiss entrepreneur by the name of Carlo Gatti, working in the London catering trade, brought a shipment of 400 tons of ice to London in 1857 from Norway. Norway then became the dominant provider of ice to London until the end of the century when mechanical refrigeration appeared on the scene. Without fridges, however, Gatti had to ensure the ice would not melt, so he had two ice wells built in Wharf Road near King&#8217;s Cross.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The ice from Norway started its life in frozen lakes, some of them artificially made for the purpose of harvesting. Ice is produced when water starts freezing at 40&#160; &#778;F, or 5&#160; &#778;C, but in order to be harvested the frozen ice needs to be around a minimum of half a metre thick, both to create large enough blocks for harvesting and to support the weight of workers and horses involved in the process. The ice cutting was typically carried out at night when the ice was thicker.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The optimum harvest time in Norway was between December and February when the ice was sufficiently thick to be cut. Mild winters could result in ice famines, with one such event occurring in Norway in 1898 seriously affecting the UK ice market.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The quality of the ice varied with the hardest and clearest being reserved for table use and the rest for the commercial world. This seasonal work provided useful employment at a quiet time of the year.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Ice harvesting required a range of specialist tools, including chisels, ice saws and grapples, and protective equipment, such as special shoes for both the workers and horses. At the beginning of the ice harvest, the surface of the area on a lake selected for harvesting was cleaned of snow, and the ice thickness&#160;was tested. This cleaned area was marked out by a worker and a horse pulling a cutter, much like a slim plough, with parallel blades that created long grooves in the lake surface. The ice was then cut along these grooves using metal handsaws. The blocks needed to be manageable for workers lifting and dragging them using the grapples.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The size of individual blocks varied according to their final destination with the smallest being about half a metre square. As about a quarter of the ice could be lost from melting during transport and storage, the further away the destination, the larger the individual blocks needed to be.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In Norway, the artificial lakes for ice harvesting were close to the sea for ease of export. Once the ice blocks were floated to the lake shore, they were lifted out of the water using the grapples and slid along the ice to special slides, which formed a wooden railway carrying the ice down to the docks, where they were loaded onto ships bound for London. Once they reached the London docks, the blocks of ice were unloaded onto horse-drawn barges, and taken along the canal to the underground ice wells in Wharf Road at King&#8217;s Cross. There they could be kept for months until they were needed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As the demand for ice grew, a host of related industries grew up around the ice trade. Apart from the production of the specialist tools and clothing, manuals were printed on how to create artificial lakes for ice harvesting; and special ships and train wagons for delivery of the ice were built among other new developments. The growth of the ice trade also affected the timber industry, as otherwise useless sawdust became a valuable commodity for packing and storing ice during transport.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The ice itself was much sought after by meat and fish sellers, and by pharmacists for various other purposes, including medicine to alleviate sprains and inflammation. But one particular consequence of the shipping of cheaper ice from Norway to London, for which Carlo Gatti is credited, is the introduction and growth of large-scale ice cream production, which prior to this had been the preserve of a few.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the end, mechanical refrigeration removed the need to transport ice, but this new process led to the relative ease of the production, storage and distribution of ice cream.<br></div>",

        "content": "<b>The age of automation</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Automation is gathering pace around the world. Should we fear or embrace and control it?<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>A.&#160;</b><span>Automation as a term only gained wide currency after the late 1940s when a department devoted to automation was set up within the motor company Ford. Then other organisations began to follow suit. Automation, in modern terms, is a process where systems such as those in telephony, in manufacturing production, for example automobiles and machine parts, are controlled by machines, with limited need for human involvement. Other examples of similar systems that can be controlled automatically are heating systems, and processes such as robotic assistants, cleaners, and banking systems, with the number of areas now increasing at a hectic pace.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>B.&#160;</b></span><span>Automation is driven by a variety of interconnected factors. Economic gain is the primary reason that most are likely to give as the impetus behind any development in the field. The human desire for improvement, the joy of creating something new, the development of innovative processes and essentially the competitive side of the creative human process, are also important factors. Another factor is the desire to make life more convenient and comfortable. To have a chance of catching on as a desirable product, many new inventions in the automation field that are outside the gaze of the public eye, such as computerised banking systems, have only to pass the test of functionality. But if a product such as a personal robot requires direct human interaction, it must have some aesthetic appeal.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b><span>New discoveries have always shaped society with different types of jobs being created, then lost and new ones being generated. For example, the process involved in making a telephone call in the early days of telephony now seems very cumbersone to people today. The caller had to contact an operator, who then connected the caller to someone at the other end of the line. A significant milestone in the history of telephony, and hence modern day automation, was reached in the early 1900s when telephone exchanges became automated with the introduction of dial telephones. Prior to automation, operators were a necessity, but as customers wishing to make calls transmitted the telephone number to an automatic switching system, these workers were replaced with electromechanical systems. Dialing numbers was then replaced with pushing buttons, and buttons with touch screens on smartphones. One wonders how much longer it will be before touch screens are superseded by touching the air, as virtual reality headsets dispense with machines like computer screens, landline phones and mobiles altogether.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>D.&#160;&#160;</b></span><span>As the process of telephony has developed, the new jobs to build and operate the system created in its early days have disappeared. Over time, telephony has evolved with the constant creation of new professions that range across invention, design, manufacturing and then maintenance of new systems and also embrace computerised and digital systems, with increasing input from a wide range of creative and entertainment media.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>E.&#160;</b></span><span>The latest developments in 3-D printing promise even further revolutionary developments in all fields, not just industry, as such devices print not only physical structures, but circuitry for using advanced digital systems. The impact on manufacturing jobs could be huge with production costs being reduced, but new avenues and opportunities will open up as greater numbers of creative designers and engineers to create, build and then service the equipment become essential. Further, as with all such developments, new professions that are now unforeseen will be created.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>F.&#160; </b>It is not surprising that people&#8217;s attention is drawn to job losses with the spread of automation. Current predictions of job losses running into millions, if not tens of millions, of internet posts worldwide do not paint a rosy picture of the future. Yet if history is anything to go by, the human race should feel more positive about the world to come. What is, perhaps, different now and is more menacing for the general public is the fact that technology is introducing changes in all directions at the same time, not just by way of automation, and it is, therefore, more disruptive.<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>G.&#160;</b> What is surprising is that around the world working environments are suffering from a lack of appropriately skilled workers to meet the very technological changes by way of more specialised technical jobs in the creative industries, for example, that are being thrown up by automation. Governments, companies and individuals need to rise to the challenge and seize the opportunities with the former putting more money, effort and strategic leadership into preparing workers for the workplaces and careers of the future. As well as skills training, help for workers with guidance in being flexible and willing to adapt and manage change is vital. If the workers of the future are to flourish, they must not leave the future to chance, but embrace and control the age of automation.<br></span></div>",

She was the first woman to receive a doctor of science degree in France, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, the first woman to lecture at the Sorbonne, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, and the first Nobel Laureate whose child also won a Nobel Prize. Her life offers insights into the changing role of women in science and academia over the past century.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Although Marie&#8217;s family was not wealthy, both parents were teachers and instilled in their children a love of learning and a deep patriotism, which led to her opposing the Russian occupation of her country. At the time of her birth, Poland was not an independent country and Warsaw was in the part of Poland that was under the control of Russia. Czar Alexander II, the then ruler of Russia, hoped to stamp out Polish nationalism by keeping the people ignorant of their culture and language, and schools were strictly controlled. Although Marie did very well in her school studies, her early days did not show any startling characteristic to indicate that one day she would become the most famous woman scientist in the world.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Marie, along with her sister, Bronya, started attending the Floating University. The name &#8216;Floating University&#8217; derived from the fact that it was an illegal night school and its classes met in changing locations to evade the watchful eyes of the Russian authorities. It was obvious that the education given by the Floating University could not match the education provided by any major European university. Both Marie and her sister nurtured a hope of going to Paris to study at the Sorbonne University, however, their father was not in a position to send them to Paris for higher studies. Both the sisters realised that individually, they did not have enough resources to enable them to go to Paris, so they decided that one of them would go first by pulling their resources together. Bronya went first, as she was the older sister and they agreed that Bronya would fund Marie after her graduation as a doctor. Marie worked several years as a governess to finance her older sister&#8217;s studies at the Sorbonne. In 1890, Bronya graduated and a year later, Marie began her university degree in Paris. At graduation, one of two women in a graduating class of several thousand, Curie ranked first in physics.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After graduation, Marie returned to Poland, as she intended to work there and care for her father. However, she was persuaded by fellow scientist Pierre Curie to return to Paris. Pierre wrote, &#8220;It would be a beautiful thing if we could spend our lives near each other. Hypnotized by our dreams - your patriotic dream, our humanitarian dream and our scientific dream.&#8221; Pierre and Marie married and began their historic collaboration on the nature of radioactivity at a small institute out of the mainstream of the scientific establishment.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1896, Becquerel had shown that uranium compounds, even if they were kept in the dark, emitted rays that would fog a photographic plate. This was an accidental discovery, as he was trying to find out whether the new radioactivity discovered by Roentgen could have a connection with fluorescence. The scientific community initially ignored Becquerel&#8217;s intriguing finding. Marie, however, decided to make a systematic investigation of the mysterious uranium rays for her doctorate degree. Marie found that two uranium minerals, pitchblende and chalcocite, were more active than uranium itself, so she hypothesised that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Working in the small institute with Pierre, Marie had an independence she might not have had at the Sorbonne, where she probably would have been expected to elaborate some superior&#8217;s work. In their joint work, Pierre observed the properties of the radiation, while Marie purified the radioactive elements. By July 1903, they had isolated a new element, and they wrote, &#8220;We propose to call it polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.&#8221; Soon they had isolated another new element, radium. Both the new elements were much more radioactive than uranium and their discoveries brought the Curies international fame with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 1903.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Following Pierre&#8217;s death in a road accident in 1906, Marie&#8217;s status changed again. Now she was a celebrated woman of accomplishment without a husband to make the celebrity acceptable. Marie was appointed as a professor at the Sorbonne University, but her application for membership in the Academy of Sciences in 1910 was rejected, and there can be little doubt she was refused because she was a woman. After this humiliation, Marie became involved in a romantic scandal, but, in spite of public outrage and the objections of some members of the Swedish Academy, Marie received her second Nobel Prize in 1911.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Over the next 20 or so years, Marie worked with radioactive elements and, because the dangers of working with them were not fully understood at that time, the long exposure led to her sickness and death from a type of leukaemia at the age of 66. The amount of radiation she was exposed to is shown by the fact that her old papers and even her cookbook from a hundred years ago are still too dangerous to handle without specialised protective clothing.</span><br></span></div>",

        "content": "<b>Tidal Energy</b><div><br></div><div>Tidal energy is a form of hydropower that utilises large amounts of power within the ocean&#8217;s tides to generate electricity. Tidal energy is a renewable energy source, as the Earth uses the gravitational forces of both the moon and the sun everyday to move vast quantities of water around the oceans to produce tides.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are different kinds of tidal power systems. A tidal barrage is a type of tidal power generation that involves the construction of a fairly low dam wall, known as a &#8216;barrage&#8217;, across the entrance of a tidal inlet or basin, creating a tidal reservoir. This dam has a number of underwater tunnels cut into its width allowing seawater to flow through them in a controllable way, using a sluice gate on the sea and reservoir side, which can slide down or up to release or retain water as desired. Fixed within the tunnels are propellers that are turned by the tidal flow and they in turn spin a turbine. The movement creates a magnetic field within the generator above, which is converted to electricity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>One disadvantage of tidal barrage electricity generation is that it can only generate electricity when the tide is actually flowing either in or out, as during high and low tide times the tidal water is stationary. However, as the tides are completely predictable, it is straightforward to plan how to compensate for low generation times with other providers in the energy mix. Supporters of tidal power also point out that other renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind farms, are much more unpredictable and intermittent. Other disadvantages of a tidal barrage system are the high construction costs and the environmental effects that a long concrete dam may have on the estuary it spans.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A tidal stream generation system reduces some of the environmental effects of tidal barrages by using turbine generators beneath the surface of the water. Major tidal flows and ocean currents, like the Gulf Stream, can be exploited to extract their tidal energy, using underwater rotors and turbines. Tidal stream generation is very similar in principal to wind power generation, except this time, water currents flow across a turbine&#8217;s rotor blades that rotate the turbine, much like how wind currents turn the blades for wind power turbines. In fact, tidal stream generation areas on the seabed can look just like underwater wind farms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Unlike offshore wind power turbines, which can suffer from storms or heavy sea damage, tidal stream turbines operate just below the sea surface or are fixed to the seabed. Tidal streams are formed by the horizontal fast flowing volumes of water caused by the ebb and flow of the tide, as the profile of the seabed causes the water to speed up as it approaches the shoreline. As water is much denser than air and has a much slower flow rate, tidal stream turbines have much smaller diameters and higher tip speed rates compared to an equivalent wind turbine. One of the disadvantages of tidal stream generation is that, as the turbines are submerged under the surface of the water, they can create hazards to navigation and shipping.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A good example of a successful tidal power project is the La Rance power station in France. This tidal barrage is still the largest tidal power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity, with a peak rating of 240 megawatts generated by its 24 turbines, and an annual output of approximately 600 gigawatts. The development costs were significant, even back in 1966 when it was opened, but these have now been recovered and electricity production costs are lower than that of nuclear power. The high cost of tidal barrages, however, is what has discouraged the further construction of similar projects.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The environment at La Rance has remained healthy, but there have been changes. The barrage has caused limited silting of the Rance ecosystem, although this has been manageable. Sand eels and plaice have reduced in numbers, but sea bass and cuttlefish have returned to the river. The tidal flows are regulated in the estuary by the operators, who adjust them to minimise the biological impact.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The La Rance tidal plant produces a source of energy that is clean, renewable and sustainable. It has no impact on climate, because it does not emit any greenhouse gases. The pattern of the tides is preserved, so that the impact on species living in the estuary is minimal. The operator monitors the tides and weather forecasts to program the barrage operations on a weekly basis.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since the construction of the barrage, a new ecological equilibrium has been established in the Rance estuary and there is an abundance of fish, bird and other wild life. The mean water level in the lagoon is higher than it was before the construction, which has promoted an increase in boating and sailing activities. The facility attracts approximately 70,000 visitors per year and a canal lock in the west end of the dam permits the passage of 20,000 vessels each year between the English Channel and the Rance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Tidal power offers society a clean and renewable source of energy. Although technology is still at a relatively immature stage, economic projections indicate that tidal energy could become cost- competitive over the long-term and governments should explore potential sites for taking advantage of these natural opportunities.<br></div>",

        "content": "<b>READING PASSAGE 3</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Is imprisonment the solution to crime? With soaring crime rates being made up mostly of re-offenders, people are questioning the effectiveness of prisons and whether there are viable options to replace or work in conjunction with them.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There seems to be confusion as to what exactly prison is for. Prison director, Katherine Soames, has mixed feelings about her establishment&#8217;s purpose. &#8220;Some say prison is for punishment, but prison is an oblique and expensive way of punishing people. Heavy fines would surely give back more to society than having them languish in a cell. Some say deterrence is the main factor, but there is little evidence of such an effect. Hardened criminals do not fear prison and short prison sentences are probably counterproductive in that they operate as &#8216;schools for crime&#8217;. As for rehabilitation, prisons stigmatise people, sever family ties and make it more difficult to get employment on release.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another reason sometimes given for putting people in prison is retribution, the argument being that people should &#8216;have to pay for what they have done&#8217;. Unfortunately, this often penalises people for the consequences of their behaviour, regardless of whether harm was intended. If a driver falls asleep at the wheel and causes the death of ten people, he has no more criminal intent than if he hit a tree and injured himself. He is not dangerous after his driving licence has been taken away, but a man was recently sentenced to five years in prison for this. Prosecutor Angela Martin comments on this case. &#8220;While prison might please the relatives of those killed, it is unnecessary for the protection of society and expensive to the taxpayer. I believe the only proper use of prison is for the containment of dangerous criminals, including violent men and serial burglars who cannot be reformed.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Can prison be of use at rehabilitation? Ministry of Justice executive, Colin Case, explains some facts. &#8220;Recidivism figures give little cause for optimism regarding the effectiveness of short- or medium-term prison sentences. Ministry of Justice figures show that a crime is committed every 10 minutes by a criminal on bail.&#8221; Other figures support Case. In the UK for example, one-third of those cautioned or convicted last year had at least 15 previous convictions and only ten per cent were first time offenders. One 66-year-old shoplifter had 330 convictions over fifty years and was still released immediately with a short prison sentence, because he had already served half of it while awaiting trial.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Can we predict in advance which criminals are likely to reoffend? Researchers have attempted to do so. Recently, a study measured impulse control while monitoring brain activity with an MRI. Error-related responses in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) indicative of impulsiveness were predictive of rearrest within the four years following release from prison. Those with low activity in the ACC were about twice as likely to be recidivists. The researcher in charge of the study, Sophie Meaker, comments on the results. &#8220;While our study gives us some data to help guide our actions with regard to&#160;reoffending, they are still not accurate enough for determining life-altering decisions with respect to individuals.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>One possible more humane alternative to prison and one of the best is community service. This has elements of punishment (deprivation of freedom and some degree of humiliation), reparation (payback to the community) and rehabilitation (it maintains community ties and promotes a work ethic). Jason Howell, a judge in Australia, is a fan. &#8220;It is better than short-term prison sentences at reducing reoffending and allows monitoring without a prison sentence. It can take the pressure off the prison system, yet still enforce justice.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another answer to the over-crowding and ineffectiveness of prison is to turn to electronic tagging, which is the attachment of a transmitter to an offender, usually to the ankle. A control centre can monitor the whereabouts and movements of anyone wearing a tag. This can and ought to be used as a sentence in itself or part of an early release system. It can enforce many of the benefits of prison by requiring offenders to be at home for certain specified hours of the day or night, without incurring the expense of running the prison.<br></div><div><br></div><div>John Dawson, a US child psychologist, explains one key benefit. &#8220;Electronic tagging can be of immeasurable benefit for young offenders. Instead of being sent to a young offenders&#8217; institute, where they might mix and learn bad habits from other offenders, they can remain in society with their families, and still be monitored. Many young people are very scared by the repercussions of what they have done and keeping them away from negative role models can be enough to allow them to avoid a life of crime.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Research has suggested that electronic tagging would create significant monetary savings, although so far, conclusions have only been based on extrapolating the results of limited trials. There has also been some criticism. Activist Tom Wilkinson argues that tagging should be illegal. &#8220;Tagging clearly contravenes a couple of basic human rights, such as the right not to undergo degrading treatment or the right to a private family life. Tagged prisoners have frequently complained of being stigmatised and treated like animals.&#8221; Parole officer, Alison Headley, opposes tagging for almost an opposite reason. &#8220;Tagging is a soft option and one that most prisoners, especially re-offenders, would prefer. It does not punish sufficiently or effectively and does not discourage re-offending.&#8221; When taking this into account, it seems that tagging is not a suitable measure for re-offenders.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Whatever one&#8217;s point of view, finding the right solution to the punishment system in today&#8217;s society is still open to debate. Prison will continue to be widely used, but there will be constant efforts to find alternatives that can punish effectively in an economic way.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Recidivism &#8211; A return to criminal behaviour.</div><div>MRI &#8211; Magnetic resonance imaging.</div><div>Parole &#8211; The conditional release of a prisoner with certain agreed requirements.</div></div>",

They are uniquely adapted to the extreme conditions of the Arctic Circle, where temperatures can reach &#8212;40&#176;C. One reason for this is that they have up to 11 centimetres of fat underneath their skin. Humans with comparative levels of adipose tissue would be considered obese and would be likely to suffer from diabetes and heart disease. Yet the polar bear experiences no such consequences.&#160;</div><div><br></div></div><div>A 2014 study by Shi Ping Liu and colleagues sheds light on this mystery. They compared the genetic structure of polar bears with that of their closest relatives from a warmer climate, the brown bears. This allowed them to determine the genes that have allowed polar bears to survive in one of the toughest environments on Earth. Liu and his colleagues found the polar bears had a gene known as APoB, which reduces levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) &#8212; a form of 'bad' cholesterol. In humans, mutations of this gene are associated with increased risk of heart disease. Polar bears may therefore be an important study model to understand heart disease in humans.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The genome of the polar bear may also provide the solution for another condition, one that particularly affects our older generation: osteoporosis. This is a disease where bones show reduced density, usually caused by insufficient exercise, reduced calcium intake or food starvation. Bone tissue is constantly being remodelled, meaning that bone is added or removed, depending on nutrient availability and the stress that the bone is under. Female polar bears, however, undergo extreme conditions during every pregnancy. Once autumn comes around, these females will dig maternity dens in the snow and will remain there throughout the winter, both before and after the birth of their cubs. This process results in about six months of fasting, where the female bears have to keep themselves and their cubs alive, depleting their own calcium and calorie reserves. Despite this, their bones remain strong and dense.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Physiologists Alanda Lennox and Allen Goodship found an explanation for this paradox in 2008. They discovered that pregnant bears were able to increase the density of their bones before they started to build their dens. In addition, six months later, when they finally emerged from the den with their cubs, there was no evidence of significant loss of bone density. Hibernating brown bears do not have this capacity and must therefore resort to major bone reformation in the following spring. If the mechanism of bone remodelling in polar bears can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><div>The medical benefits of the polar bear for humanity certainly have their importance in our conservation efforts, but these should not be the only factors taken into consideration. We tend to want to protect animals we think are intelligent and possess emotions, such as elephants and primates. Bears, on the other hand, seem to be perceived as stupid and in many cases violent. And yet anecdotal evidence from the field challenges those assumptions, suggesting for example that polar bears have good problem-solving abilities. A male bear called GoGo in Tennoji Zoo, Osaka, has even been observed making use of a tool to manipulate his environment. The bear used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat hung out of his reach. Problem-solving ability has also been witnessed in wild polar bears, although not as obviously as with GoGo. A calculated move by a male bear involved running and jumping onto barrels in an attempt to get to a photographer standing on a platform four metres high.&#160;</div></div><div><br></div><div>In other studies, such as one by Alison Ames in 2008, polar bears showed deliberate and focussed manipulation. For example, Ames observed bears putting objects in piles and then knocking them over in what appeared to be a game. The study demonstrates that bears are capable of agile and thought-out behaviours. These examples suggest bears have greater creativity and problem-solving abilities than previously thought.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div>As for emotions, while the evidence is once again anecdotal, many bears have been seen to hit out at ice and snow &#8212; seemingly out of frustration &#8212; when they have just missed out on a kill. Moreover, polar bears can form unusual relationships with other species, including playing with the dogs used to pull sleds in the Arctic. Remarkably, one hand-raised polar bear called Agee has formed a close relationship with her owner Mark Dumas to the point where they even swim together. This is even more astonishing since polar bears are known to actively hunt humans in the wild.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>If climate change were to lead to their extinction, this would mean not only the loss of potential breakthroughs in human medicine, but more importantly, the disappearance of an intelligent, majestic animal.&#160;</div></div><div><br></div></div>",

The pyramids are the most famous monuments of ancient Egypt and still hold enormous interest for people in the present day. These grand, impressive tributes to the memory of the Egyptian kings have become linked with the country even though other cultures, such as the Chinese and Mayan, also built pyramids. The evolution of the pyramid form has been written and argued about for centuries. However, there is no question that, as far as Egypt is concerned, it began with one monument to one king designed by one brilliant architect: the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>B. </b>Djoser was the first king of the Third Dynasty of Egypt and the first to build in stone. Prior to Djoscr's reign, tombs were rectangular monuments made of dried clay brick, which covered underground passages where the deceased person was buried. For reasons which remain unclear, Djoser's main official, whose name was Imhotep, conceived of building a taller, more impressive tomb for his king by stacking stone slabs on top of one another, progressively making them smaller, to form the shape now known as the Step Pyramid. Djoser is thought to have reigned for 19 years, but some historians and scholars attribute a much longer time for his rule, owing to the number and size of the monuments he built.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>C.&#160;</b>The Step Pyramid has been thoroughly examined and investigated over the last century, and it is now known that the building process went through many different stages. Historian Marc Van de Mieroop comments on this, writing &#8216;Much experimentation was involved, which is especially clear in the construction of the pyramid in the centre of the complex. It had several plans ... before it became the first Step Pyramid in history, piling six levels on top of one another ... The weight of the enormous mass was a challenge for the builders, who placed the stones at an inward incline in order to prevent the monument breaking up.&#8217;</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>D.&#160;</b>When finally completed, the Step Pyramid rose 62 metres high and was the tallest structure of its time. The complex in which it was built was the size of a city in ancient Egypt and included a temple, courtyards, shrines, and living quarters for the priests. It covered a region of 16 hectares and was surrounded by a wall 10.5 metres high. The wall had 13 false doors cut into it with only one true entrance cut into the south-east corner; the entire wall was then ringed by a trench 750 meters long and 40 metres wide. The false doors and the trench were incorporated into the complex to discourage unwanted visitors. If someone wished to enter, he or she would have needed to know in advance how to find the location of the true opening in the wall. Djoser was so proud of his accomplishment that he broke the tradition of having only his own name on the monument and had Imhotep's name carved on it as well.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>E. </b>The burial chamber of the tomb, where the king's body was laid to rest, was dug beneath the base of the pyramid, surrounded by a vast maze of long tunnels that had rooms off them to discourage robbers. One of the most mysterious discoveries found inside the pyramid was a large number of stone vessels. Over 40,000 of these vessels, of various forms and shapes, were discovered in storerooms off the pyramid's underground passages. They are inscribed with the names of rulers from the First and Second Dynasties of Egypt and made from different kinds of stone. There is no agreement among scholars and archaeologists on why the vessels were placed in the tomb of Djoser or what they were supposed to represent. The archaeologist Jean-Philippe Lauer, who excavated most of the pyramid and complex, believes they were originally stored and then given a 'proper burial' by Djoser in his pyramid to honor his predecessors. There are other historians; however, who claim the vessels were dumped into the shafts as yet another attempt to prevent grave robbers from getting to the king's burial chamber.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>F.&#160;</b>Unfortunately, all of the precautions and intricate design of the underground network did not prevent ancient robbers from finding a way in. Djoser's grave goods, and even his body, were stolen at some point in the past and all archaeologists found were a small number of his valuables overlooked by the thieves. There was enough left throughout the pyramid and its complex;, however, to astonish and amaze the archaeologists who excavated it.</span></div><div><br><b>G.</b> Egyptologist Miroslav Verner writes, 'Few monuments hold a place in human history as significant as that of the Step Pyramid in Saqqara. It can be said without exaggeration that this pyramid complex constitutes a milestone in the evolution of monumental stone architecture in Egypt and in the world as a whole.' The Step Pyramid was a revolutionary advance in architecture and became the archetype which all the other great pyramid builders of Egypt would follow.&#160;<br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>The future of work&#160;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>According to a leading business consultancy, 3-14% of the global workforce will need to switch to a different occupation within the next 10-15 years, and all workers will need to adapt as their occupations evolve alongside increasingly capable machines. Automation &#8212; or 'embodied artificial intelligence (Al) &#8212; is one aspect of the disruptive effects of technology on the labour market. 'Disembodied Al', like the algorithms running in our smartphones, is another.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr Stella Pachidi from Cambridge Judge Business School believes that some of the most fundamental changes are happening as a result of the 'algorithmication' of jobs that are dependent on data rather than on production &#8212; the so-called knowledge economy. Algorithms are capable of learning from data to undertake tasks that previously needed human judgement. such as reading legal contracts, analysing medical scans and gathering market intelligence.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;In many cases, they can outperform humans,&#8217; says Pachidi. &#8216;Organisations are attracted to using algorithms because they want to make choices based on what they consider is &#34;perfect information&#34;, as well as to reduce costs and enhance productivity.&#8217;&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;But these enhancements are not without consequences,&#8217; says Pachidi. 'If routine cognitive tasks are taken over by Al, how do professions develop their future experts?' she asks. &#8216;One way of learning about a job is &#34;legitimate peripheral participation&#34;&#8212; a novice stands next to experts and learns by observation. If this isn't happening, then you need to find new ways to learn.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Another issue is the extent to which the technology influences or even controls the workforce. For over two years, Pachidi monitored a telecommunications company. 'The way telecoms salespeople work is through personal and frequent contact with clients, using the benefit of experience to assess a situation and reach a decision. However, the company had started using a [n] ... algorithm that defined when account managers should contact certain customers about which kinds of campaigns and what to offer them.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>The algorithm &#8212; usually built by external designers &#8212; often becomes the keeper of knowledge, she explains. In cases like this, Pachidi believes, a short-sighted view begins to creep into working practices whereby workers learn through the 'algorithm's eyes' and become dependent on its instructions. Alternative explorations &#8212; where experimentation and human instinct lead to progress and new ideas &#8212; are effectively discouraged.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Pachidi and colleagues even observed people developing strategies to make the algorithm work to their own advantage. 'We are seeing cases where workers feed the algorithm with false data to reach their targets,' she reports.&#160;</div><div>It's scenarios like these that many researchers am working to avoid. Their objective is to make Al technologies more trustworthy and transparent, so that organisations and individuals understand how Al decisions are made. In the meantime, says Pachidi, 'We need to make sure we fully understand the dilemmas that this new world raises regarding expertise, occupational boundaries and control.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Economist Professor Hamish Low believes that the future of work will involve major transitions across the whole life course for everyone: 'The traditional trajectory of full-time education followed by full-time work followed by a pensioned retirement is a thing of the past,' says Low. Instead, he envisages a multistage employment life: one where retraining happens across the life course, and where multiple jobs and no job happen by choice at different stages.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>On the subject of job losses, Low believes the predictions are founded on a fallacy: 'It assumes that the number of jobs is fixed. If in 30 years, half of 100 jobs are being carried out by robots, that doesn't mean we are left with just 50 jobs for humans. The number of jobs will increase: we would expect there to be 150 jobs.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr Ewan McGaughey. at Cambridge's Centre for Business Research and King's College London agrees that 'apocalyptic' views about the future of work are misguided. 'It's the laws that restrict the supply of capital to the job market, not the advent of new technologies that causes unemployment.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>His recently published research answers the question of whether automation. Al and robotics will mean a 'jobless future' by looking at the causes of unemployment. &#8216;History is clear that change can mean redundancies. But social policies can tackle this through retraining and redeployment.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>He adds: 'If there is going to be change to jobs as a result of Al and robotics then I'd like to see governments seizing the opportunity to improve policy to enforce good job security. We can reprogramme the law to prepare for a fairer future of work and leisure.' McGaughey's findings are a call to arms to leaders of organisations, governments and banks to pre-empt the coming changes with bold new policies that guarantee full employment, fair incomes and a thriving economic democracy.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>'The promises of these new technologies are astounding. They deliver humankind the capacity to live in a way that nobody could have once imagined.' he adds. &#8216;Just as the industrial revolution brought people past subsistence agriculture, and the corporate revolution enabled mass production, a third revolution has been pronounced. But it will not only be one of technology. The next revolution will be social.'&#160;</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>I contain multitudes</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Wendy Moore reviews Ed Yong&#8217;s book about microbes</div><div><br></div><div>Microbes, most of them bacteria, have populated this planet since long before animal life developed and they will outlive us. Invisible to the naked eye, they are ubiquitous. They inhabit the soil, air, rocks and water and are present within every form of life, from seaweed and coral to dogs and humans. And, as Yong explains in his utterly absorbing and hugely important book we mess with them at our peril.</div><div><br></div><div>Every species has its own colony of microbes, called a &#8216;microbiome&#8217;, and these microbes vary not only between species but also between individuals and within different parts of each individual. What is amazing is that while the number of human cells in the average person is about 30 trillion, the number of microbial ones is higher &#8211; about 39 trillion. At best, Yong informs us, we are only 50 per cent human. Indeed, some scientists even suggest we should think of each species and its microbes as a single unit, dubbed a &#8216;holobiont&#8217;.</div><div><br></div><div>In each human there are microbes that live only in the stomach, the mouth or the armpit and by and large they do so peacefully. So &#8216;bad&#8217; microbes are just microbes out of context. Microbes that sit contentedly in the human gut (where there are more microbes than there are stars in the galaxy) can become deadly if they find their way into the bloodstream. These communities are constantly changing too. The right hand shares just one sixth of its microbes with the left hand. And, of course, we are surrounded by microbes. Every time we eat, we swallow a million microbes in each gram of food; we are continually swapping microbes with other humans, pets and the world at large.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#8217;s a fascinating topic and Yong, a young British science journalist, is an extraordinarily adept guide. Writing with lightness and panache, he has a knack of explaining complex science in terms that are both easy to understand and totally enthralling. Yong is on a mission. Leading us gently by the hand, he takes us into the world of microbes &#8211; a bizarre, alien planet &#8211; in a bid to persuade us to love them as much as he does. By the end, we do.</div><div><br></div><div>For most of human history we had no idea that microbes existed. The first man to see these extraordinarily potent creatures was a Dutch lens-maker called Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s. Using microscopes of his own design that could magnify up to 270 times, he examined a drop of water from a nearby lake and found it teeming with tiny creatures he called &#8216;animalcules&#8217;. It wasn&#8217;t until nearly two hundred years later that the research of French biologist Louis Pasteur indicated that some microbes caused disease. It was Pasteur&#8217;s &#8216;germ theory&#8217; that gave bacteria the poor image that endures today.</div><div><br></div><div>Yong&#8217;s book is in many ways a plea for microbial tolerance, pointing out that while fewer than one hundred species of bacteria bring disease, many thousands more play a vital role in maintaining our health. The book also acknowledges that our attitude towards bacteria is not a simple one. We tend to see the dangers posed by bacteria, yet at the same time we are sold yoghurts and drinks that supposedly nurture &#8216;friendly&#8217; bacteria. In reality, says Yong, bacteria should not be viewed as either friends or foes, villains or heroes. Instead we should realise we have a symbiotic relationship, that can be mutually beneficial or mutually destructive.</div><div><br></div><div>What then do these millions of organisms do? The answer is pretty much everything. New research is now unravelling the ways in which bacteria aid digestion, regulate our immune systems, eliminate toxins, produce vitamins, affect our behaviour and even combat obesity. &#8216;They actually help us become who we are,&#8217; says Yong. But we are facing a growing problem. Our obsession with hygiene, our overuse of antibiotics and our unhealthy, low-fibre diets are disrupting the bacterial balance and may be responsible for soaring rates of allergies and immune problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</div><div><br></div><div>The most recent research actually turns accepted norms upside down. For example, there are studies indicating that the excessive use of household detergents and antibacterial products actually destroys the microbes that normally keep the more dangerous germs at bay. Other studies show that keeping a dog as a pet gives children early exposure to a diverse range of bacteria, which may help protect them against allergies later.</div><div><br></div><div>The readers of Yong&#8217;s book must be prepared for a decidedly unglamorous world. Among the less appealing case studies is one about a fungus that is wiping out entire populations of frogs and that can be halted by a rare microbial bacterium. Another is about squid that carry luminescent bacteria that protect them against predators. However, if you can overcome your distaste for some of the investigations, the reasons for Yong&#8217;s enthusiasm become clear. The microbial world is a place of wonder. Already, in an attempt to stop mosquitoes spreading dengue fever &#8211; a disease that infects 400 million people a year &#8211; mosquitoes are being loaded with a bacterium to block the disease. In the future, our ability to manipulate microbes means we could construct buildings with useful microbes built into their walls to fight off infections. Just imagine a neonatal hospital ward coated in a specially mixed cocktail of microbes so that babies get the best start in life.</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>I contain multitudes</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Wendy Moore reviews Ed Yong&#8217;s book about microbes</div><div><br></div><div>Microbes, most of them bacteria, have populated this planet since long before animal life developed and they will outlive us. Invisible to the naked eye, they are ubiquitous. They inhabit the soil, air, rocks and water and are present within every form of life, from seaweed and coral to dogs and humans. And, as Yong explains in his utterly absorbing and hugely important book we mess with them at our peril.</div><div><br></div><div>Every species has its own colony of microbes, called a &#8216;microbiome&#8217;, and these microbes vary not only between species but also between individuals and within different parts of each individual. What is amazing is that while the number of human cells in the average person is about 30 trillion, the number of microbial ones is higher &#8211; about 39 trillion. At best, Yong informs us, we are only 50 per cent human. Indeed, some scientists even suggest we should think of each species and its microbes as a single unit, dubbed a &#8216;holobiont&#8217;.</div><div><br></div><div>In each human there are microbes that live only in the stomach, the mouth or the armpit and by and large they do so peacefully. So &#8216;bad&#8217; microbes are just microbes out of context. Microbes that sit contentedly in the human gut (where there are more microbes than there are stars in the galaxy) can become deadly if they find their way into the bloodstream. These communities are constantly changing too. The right hand shares just one sixth of its microbes with the left hand. And, of course, we are surrounded by microbes. Every time we eat, we swallow a million microbes in each gram of food; we are continually swapping microbes with other humans, pets and the world at large.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#8217;s a fascinating topic and Yong, a young British science journalist, is an extraordinarily adept guide. Writing with lightness and panache, he has a knack of explaining complex science in terms that are both easy to understand and totally enthralling. Yong is on a mission. Leading us gently by the hand, he takes us into the world of microbes &#8211; a bizarre, alien planet &#8211; in a bid to persuade us to love them as much as he does. By the end, we do.</div><div><br></div><div>For most of human history we had no idea that microbes existed. The first man to see these extraordinarily potent creatures was a Dutch lens-maker called Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s. Using microscopes of his own design that could magnify up to 270 times, he examined a drop of water from a nearby lake and found it teeming with tiny creatures he called &#8216;animalcules&#8217;. It wasn&#8217;t until nearly two hundred years later that the research of French biologist Louis Pasteur indicated that some microbes caused disease. It was Pasteur&#8217;s &#8216;germ theory&#8217; that gave bacteria the poor image that endures today.</div><div><br></div><div>Yong&#8217;s book is in many ways a plea for microbial tolerance, pointing out that while fewer than one hundred species of bacteria bring disease, many thousands more play a vital role in maintaining our health. The book also acknowledges that our attitude towards bacteria is not a simple one. We tend to see the dangers posed by bacteria, yet at the same time we are sold yoghurts and drinks that supposedly nurture &#8216;friendly&#8217; bacteria. In reality, says Yong, bacteria should not be viewed as either friends or foes, villains or heroes. Instead we should realise we have a symbiotic relationship, that can be mutually beneficial or mutually destructive.</div><div><br></div><div>What then do these millions of organisms do? The answer is pretty much everything. New research is now unravelling the ways in which bacteria aid digestion, regulate our immune systems, eliminate toxins, produce vitamins, affect our behaviour and even combat obesity. &#8216;They actually help us become who we are,&#8217; says Yong. But we are facing a growing problem. Our obsession with hygiene, our overuse of antibiotics and our unhealthy, low-fibre diets are disrupting the bacterial balance and may be responsible for soaring rates of allergies and immune problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</div><div><br></div><div>The most recent research actually turns accepted norms upside down. For example, there are studies indicating that the excessive use of household detergents and antibacterial products actually destroys the microbes that normally keep the more dangerous germs at bay. Other studies show that keeping a dog as a pet gives children early exposure to a diverse range of bacteria, which may help protect them against allergies later.</div><div><br></div><div>The readers of Yong&#8217;s book must be prepared for a decidedly unglamorous world. Among the less appealing case studies is one about a fungus that is wiping out entire populations of frogs and that can be halted by a rare microbial bacterium. Another is about squid that carry luminescent bacteria that protect them against predators. However, if you can overcome your distaste for some of the investigations, the reasons for Yong&#8217;s enthusiasm become clear. The microbial world is a place of wonder. Already, in an attempt to stop mosquitoes spreading dengue fever &#8211; a disease that infects 400 million people a year &#8211; mosquitoes are being loaded with a bacterium to block the disease. In the future, our ability to manipulate microbes means we could construct buildings with useful microbes built into their walls to fight off infections. Just imagine a neonatal hospital ward coated in a specially mixed cocktail of microbes so that babies get the best start in life.</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>How to make wise decisions</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Across cultures, wisdom has been considered one of the most revered human qualities. Although the truly wise may seem few and far between, empirical research examining wisdom suggests that it isn&#8217;t an exceptional trait possessed by a small handful of bearded philosophers after all &#8211; in fact, the latest studies suggest that most of us have the ability to make wise decisions, given the right context.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined,&#8217; says Associate Professor Igor Grossmann of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. &#8216;Recent empirical findings from cognitive, developmental, social, and personality psychology cumulatively suggest that people&#8217;s ability to reason wisely varies dramatically across experiential and situational contexts. Understanding the role of such contextual factors offers unique insights into understanding wisdom in daily life, as well as how it can be enhanced and taught.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div>It seems that it&#8217;s not so much that some people simply possess wisdom and others lack it, but that our ability to reason wisely depends on a variety of external factors. &#8216;It is impossible to characterize thought processes attributed to wisdom without considering the role of contextual factors,&#8217; explains Grossmann. &#8216;In other words, wisdom is not solely an &#8220;inner quality&#8221; but rather unfolds as a function of situations people happen to be in. Some situations are more likely to promote wisdom than others.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div>Coming up with a definition of wisdom is challenging, but Grossmann and his colleagues have identified four key characteristics as part of a framework of wise reasoning. One is intellectual humility or recognition of the limits of our own knowledge, and another is appreciation of perspectives wider than the issue at hand. Sensitivity to the possibility of change in social relations is also key, along with compromise or integration of different attitudes and beliefs.</div><div><br></div><div>Grossmann and his colleagues have also found that one of the most reliable ways to support wisdom in our own day-to-day decisions is to look at scenarios from a third-party perspective, as though giving advice to a friend. Research suggests that when adopting a first-person viewpoint we focus on &#8216;the focal features of the environment&#8217; and when we adopt a third-person, &#8216;observer&#8217; viewpoint we reason more broadly and focus more on interpersonal and moral ideals such as justice and impartiality. Looking at problems from this more expansive viewpoint appears to foster cognitive processes related to wise decisions.</div><div><br></div><div>What are we to do, then, when confronted with situations like a disagreement with a spouse or negotiating a contract at work, that require us to take a personal stake? Grossmann argues that even when we aren&#8217;t able to change the situation, we can still evaluate these experiences from different perspectives.</div><div><br></div><div>For example, in one experiment that took place during the peak of a recent economic recession, graduating college seniors were asked to reflect on their job prospects. The students were instructed to imagine their career either &#8216;as if you were a distant observer&#8217; or &#8216;before your own eyes as if you were right there&#8217;. Participants in the group assigned to the &#8216;distant observer&#8217; role displayed more wisdom-related reasoning (intellectual humility and recognition of change) than did participants in the control group.</div><div><br></div><div>In another study, couples in long-term romantic relationships were instructed to visualize an unresolved relationship conflict either through the eyes of an outsider or from their own perspective. Participants then discussed the incident with their partner for 10 minutes, after which they wrote down their thoughts about it. Couples in the &#8216;other&#8217;s eyes&#8217; condition were significantly more likely to rely on wise reasoning &#8211; recognizing others&#8217; perspectives and searching for a compromise &#8211; compared to the couples in the egocentric condition.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;Ego-decentering promotes greater focus on others and enables a bigger picture, conceptual view of the experience, affording recognition of intellectual humility and change,&#8217; says Grossmann.</div><div><br></div><div>We might associate wisdom with intelligence or particular personality traits, but research shows only a small positive relationship between wise thinking and crystallized intelligence and the personality traits of openness and agreeableness. &#8216;It is remarkable how much people can vary in their wisdom from one situation to the next, and how much stronger such contextual effects are for understanding the relationship between wise judgment and its social and affective outcomes as compared to the generalized &#8220;traits&#8221;,&#8217; Grossmann explains. &#8216;That is, knowing how wisely a person behaves in a given situation is more informative for understanding their emotions or likelihood to forgive [or] retaliate as compared to knowing whether the person may be wise &#8220;in general&#8221;.&#8217;&#160;</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>Roman shipbuilding and navigation</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Shipbuilding today is based on science and ships are built using computers and sophisticated tools. Shipbuilding in ancient Rome, however, was more of an art relying on estimation, inherited techniques and personal experience. The Romans were not traditionally sailors but mostly land-based people, who learned to build ships from the people that they conquered, namely the Greeks and the Egyptians.</div><div><br></div><div>There are a few surviving written documents that give descriptions and representations of ancient Roman ships, including the sails and rigging. Excavated vessels also provide some clues about ancient shipbuilding techniques. Studies of these have taught us that ancient Roman shipbuilders built the outer hull first, then proceeded with the frame and the rest of the ship. Planks used to build the outer hull were initially sewn together. Starting from the 6th century BCE, they were fixed using a method called mortise and tenon, whereby one plank locked into another without the need for stitching. Then in the first centuries of the current era, Mediterranean shipbuilders shifted to another shipbuilding method, still in use today, which consisted of building the frame first and then proceeding with the hull and the other components of the ship. This method was more systematic and dramatically shortened ship construction times. The ancient Romans built large merchant ships and warships whose size and technology were unequalled until the 16th century CE.</div><div><br></div><div>Warships were built to be lightweight and very speedy. They had to be able to sail near the coast which is why they had no ballast or excess load and were built with a long, narrow hull. They did not sink when damaged and often would lie crippled on the sea&#8217;s surface following naval battles. They had a bronze battering ram, which was used to pierce the timber hulls or break the oars of enemy vessels. Warships used both wind (sails) and human power (oarsmen) and were therefore very fast. Eventually, Rome&#8217;s navy became the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean, and the Romans had control over what they therefore called Mare Nostrum meaning &#8216;our sea&#8217;.</div><div><br></div><div>There were many kinds of warships. The &#8216;trireme&#8217; was the dominant warship from the 7th to 4th century BCE. It had rowers in the top, middle and lower levels, and approximately 50 rowers in each bank. The rowers at the bottom had the most uncomfortable position as they were under the other rowers and were exposed to the water entering through the oar-holes. It is worth noting that contrary to popular perception, rowers were not slaves but mostly Roman citizens enrolled in the military. The trireme was superseded by larger ships with even more rowers.</div><div><br></div><div>Merchant ships were built to transport lots of cargo over long distances and at a reasonable cost. They had a wider hull, double planking and a solid interior for added stability. Unlike warships, their V-shaped hull was deep underwater, meaning that they could not sail too close to the coast. They usually had two huge side rudders located off the stern and controlled by a small tiller bar connected to a system of cables. They had from one to three masts with large square sails and a small triangular sail at the bow. Just like warships, merchant ships used oarsmen, but coordinating the hundreds of rowers in both types of ship was not an easy task. In order to assist them, music would be played on an instrument, and oars would then keep time with this.</div><div><br></div><div>The cargo on merchant ships included raw materials (e.g. iron bars, copper, marble and granite), and agricultural products (e.g. grain from Egypt&#8217;s Nile valley). During the Empire, Rome was a huge city by ancient standards of about one million inhabitants. Goods from all over the world would come to the city through the port of Pozzuoli situated west of the bay of Naples in Italy and through the gigantic port of Ostia situated at the mouth of the Tiber River. Large merchant ships would approach the destination port and, just like today, be intercepted by a number of towboats that would drag them to the quay.</div><div><br></div><div>The time of travel along the many sailing routes could vary widely. Navigation in ancient Rome did not rely on sophisticated instruments such as compasses but on experience, local knowledge and observation of natural phenomena. In conditions of good visibility, seamen in the Mediterranean often had the mainland or islands in sight, which greatly facilitated navigation. They sailed by noting their position relative to a succession of recognisable landmarks. When weather conditions were not good or where land was no longer visible, Roman mariners estimated directions from the pole star or, with less accuracy, from the Sun at noon. They also estimated directions relative to the wind and swell. Overall, shipping in ancient Roman times resembled shipping today with large vessels regularly crossing the seas and bringing supplies from their Empire.</div><div><br></div>",

As the ice has vanished, it has been giving up the treasures it has preserved in cold storage for the last 6,000 years &#8211; items such as ancient arrows and skis from Viking Age* traders. And those artefacts have provided archaeologists with some surprising insights into how ancient Norwegians made their livings.</div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</div><div>*Viking Age: a period of European history from around 700 CE to around 1050 CE when Scandinavian Vikings migrated throughout Europe by means of trade and warfare</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b></div><div>Organic materials like textiles and hides are relatively rare finds at archaeological sites. This is because unless they&#8217;re protected from the microorganisms that cause decay, they tend not to last long. Extreme cold is one reliable way to keep artefacts relatively fresh for a few thousand years, but once thawed out, these materials experience degradation relatively swiftly.</div><div><br></div><div>With climate change shrinking ice cover around the world, glacial archaeologists need to race the clock to find newly revealed artefacts, preserve them, and study them. If something fragile dries and is windblown it might very soon be lost to science, or an arrow might be exposed and then covered again by the next snow and remain well-preserved. The unpredictability means that glacial archaeologists have to be systematic in their approach to fieldwork.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b></div><div>Over a nine-year period, a team of archaeologists, which included Lars Pil&#248; of Oppland County Council, Norway, and James Barrett of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, surveyed patches of ice in Oppland, an area of south-central Norway that is home to some of the country&#8217;s highest mountains. Reindeer once congregated on these ice patches in the later summer months to escape biting insects, and from the late Stone Age**, hunters followed. In addition, trade routes threaded through the mountain passes of Oppland, linking settlements in Norway to the rest of Europe.</div><div><br></div><div>The slow but steady movement of glaciers tends to destroy anything at their bases, so the team focused on stationary patches of ice, mostly above 1,400 metres. That ice is found amid fields of frost-weathered boulders, fallen rocks, and exposed bedrock that for nine months of the year is buried beneath snow.</div><div>&#8216;Fieldwork is hard work &#8211; hiking with all our equipment, often camping on permafrost &#8211; but very rewarding. You&#8217;re rescuing the archaeology, bringing the melting ice to wider attention, discovering a unique environmental history and really connecting with the natural environment,&#8217; says Barrett.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div><div><br></div><div>**The Stone Age: a period in early history that began about 3.4 million years ago</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.&#160;</b></div><div>At the edges of the contracting ice patches, archaeologists found more than 2,000 artefacts, which formed a material record that ran from 4,000 BCE to the beginnings of the Renaissance in the 14th century. Many of the artefacts are associated with hunting. Hunters would have easily misplaced arrows and they often discarded broken bows rather than take them all the way home. Other items could have been used by hunters traversing the high mountain passes of Oppland: all-purpose items like tools, skis, and horse tack.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b></div><div>Barrett&#8217;s team radiocarbon-dated 153 of the artefacts and compared those dates to the timing of major environmental changes in the region &#8211; such as periods of cooling or warming &#8211; and major social and economic shifts &#8211; such as the growth of farming settlements and the spread of international trade networks leading up to the Viking Age. They found that some periods had produced lots of artefacts, which indicates that people had been pretty active in the mountains during those times. But there were few or no signs of activity during other periods.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b></div><div>What was surprising, according to Barrett, was the timing of these periods. Oppland&#8217;s mountains present daunting terrain and in periods of extreme cold, glaciers could block the higher mountain passes and make travel in the upper reaches of the mountains extremely difficult. Archaeologists assumed people would stick to lower elevations during a time like the Late Antique Little Ice Age, a short period of deeper-than-usual cold from about 536-600 CE. But it turned out that hunters kept regularly venturing into the mountains even when the climate turned cold, based on the amount of stuff they had apparently dropped there.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;Remarkably, though, the finds from the ice may have continued through this period, perhaps suggesting that the importance of mountain hunting increased to supplement failing agricultural harvests in times of low temperatures,&#8217; says Barrett. A colder turn in the Scandinavian climate would likely have meant widespread crop failures, so more people would have depended on hunting to make up for those losses.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.&#160;</b></div><div>Many of the artefacts Barrett&#8217;s team recovered date from the beginning of the Viking Age, the 700s through to the 900s CE. Trade networks connecting Scandinavia with Europe and the Middle East were expanding around this time. Although we usually think of ships when we think of Scandinavian expansion, these recent discoveries show that plenty of goods travelled on overland routes, like the mountain passes of Oppland. And growing Norwegian towns, along with export markets, would have created a booming demand for hides to fight off the cold, as well as antlers to make useful things like combs. Business must have been good for hunters.</div><div><br></div><div><b>H.</b></div><div>Norway&#8217;s mountains are probably still hiding a lot of history &#8211; and prehistory &#8211; in remote ice patches. When Barrett&#8217;s team looked at the dates for their sample of 153 artefacts, they noticed a gap with almost no artefacts from about 3,800 to 2,200 BCE. In fact, archaeological finds from that period are rare all over Norway. The researchers say that could be because many of those artefacts have already disintegrated or are still frozen in the ice. That means archaeologists could be extracting some of those artefacts from retreating ice in years to come.</div><div><br></div>",

Scientists say the discovery could help breed crops that are more resilient to the temperatures expected to result from climate change</div><div>An international team of scientists led by the University of Cambridge has discovered that the &#8216;thermometer&#8217; molecule in plants enables them to develop according to seasonal temperature changes. Researchers have revealed that molecules called phytochromes &#8211; used by plants to detect light during the day &#8211; actually change their function in darkness to become cellular temperature gauges that measure the heat of the night.</div><div>The new findings, published in the journal Science, show that phytochromes control genetic switches in response to temperature as well as light to dictate plant development.</div><div>At night, these molecules change states, and the pace at which they change is &#8216;directly proportional to temperature&#8217;, say scientists, who compare phytochromes to mercury in a thermometer. The warmer it is, the faster the molecular change &#8211; stimulating plant growth.</div><div>Farmers and gardeners have known for hundreds of years how responsive plants are to temperature: warm winters cause many trees and flowers to bud early, something humans have long used to predict weather and harvest times for the coming year. The latest research pinpoints for the first time a molecular mechanism in plants that reacts to temperature &#8211; often triggering the buds of spring we long to see at the end of winter.</div><div>With weather and temperatures set to become ever more unpredictable due to climate change, researchers say the discovery that this light-sensing molecule also functions as the internal thermometer in plant cells could help us breed tougher crops. &#8216;It is estimated that agricultural yields will need to double by 2050, but climate change is a major threat to achieving this. Key crops such as wheat and rice are sensitive to high temperatures. Thermal stress reduces crop yields by around 10% for every one degree increase in temperature,&#8217; says lead researcher Dr Philip Wigge from Cambridge&#8217;s Sainsbury Laboratory. &#8216;Discovering the molecules that allow plants to sense temperature has the potential to accelerate the breeding of crops resilient to thermal stress and climate change.&#8217;</div><div>In their active state, phytochrome molecules bind themselves to DNA to restrict plant growth. During the day, sunlight activates the molecules, slowing down growth. If a plant finds itself in shade, phytochromes are quickly inactivated &#8211; enabling it to grow faster to find sunlight again. This is how plants compete to escape each other&#8217;s shade. &#8216;Light-driven changes to phytochrome activity occur very fast, in less than a second,&#8217; says Wigge.</div><div>At night, however, it&#8217;s a different story. Instead of a rapid deactivation following sundown, the molecules gradually change from their active to inactive state. This is called &#8216;dark reversion&#8217;. &#8216;Just as mercury rises in a thermometer, the rate at which phytochromes revert to their inactive state during the night is a direct measure of temperature,&#8217; says Wigge.</div><div>&#8216;The lower the temperature, the slower the rate at which phytochromes revert to inactivity, so the molecules spend more time in their active, growth-suppressing state. This is why plants are slower to grow in winter. Warm temperatures accelerate dark reversion, so that phytochromes rapidly reach an inactive state and detach themselves from the plant&#8217;s DNA &#8211; allowing genes to be expressed and plant growth to resume.&#8217; Wigge believes phytochrome thermo-sensing evolved at a later stage, and co-opted the biological network already used for light-based growth during the downtime of night.</div><div>Some plants mainly use day length as an indicator of the reason. Other species, such as daffodils, have considerable temperature sensitivity, and can flower months in advance during a warm winter. In fact, the discovery of the dual role of phytochromes provides the science behind a well-known rhyme long used to predict the coming season: oak before ash we&#8217;ll have a splash, ash before oak we&#8217;re in for a soak.</div><div>Wigge explains: &#8216;Oak trees rely much more on temperature, likely using phytochromes as thermometers to dictate development, whereas ash trees rely on measuring day length to determine their seasonal timing. A warmer spring, and consequently a higher likeliness of a hot summer, will result in oak leafing before ash. A cold spring will see the opposite. As the British know only too well, a colder summer is likely to be a rain-soaked one.&#8217;</div><div>The new findings are the culmination of twelve years of research involving scientists from Germany, Argentina and the US, as well as the Cambridge team. The work was done in a model system, using a mustard plant called Arabidopsis, but Wigge says the phytochrome genes necessary for temperature sensing are found in crop plants as well. &#8216;Recent advances in plant genetics now mean that scientists are able to rapidly identify the genes controlling these processes in crop plants, and even alter their activity using precise molecular &#8220;scalpels&#8221;,&#8217; adds Wigge. &#8216;Cambridge is uniquely well-positioned to do this kind of research as we have outstanding collaborators nearby who work on more applied aspects of plant biology, and can help us transfer this new knowledge into the field.&#8217;</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>Roman tunnels</b></div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><i>The Romans, who once controlled areas of Europe, North Africa and Asia Minor, adopted the construction techniques of other civilizations to build tunnels in their territories</i></div><div><br></div><div>The Persians, who lived in present-day Iran, were one of the first civilizations to build tunnels that provided a reliable supply of water to human settlements in dry areas. In the early first millennium BCE, they introduced the qanat method of tunnel construction, which consisted of placing posts over a hill in a straight line, to ensure that the tunnel kept to its route, and then digging vertical shafts down into the ground at regular intervals. Underground, workers removed the earth from between the ends of the shafts, creating a tunnel. The excavated soil was taken up to the surface using the shafts, which also provided ventilation during the work. Once the tunnel was completed, it allowed water to flow from the top of a hillside down towards a canal, which supplied water for human use. Remarkably, some qanats built by the Persians 2,700 years ago are still in use today.</div><div><br></div><div>They later passed on their knowledge to the Romans, who also used the qanat method to construct water-supply tunnels for agriculture. Roma qanat tunnels were constructed with vertical shafts dug at intervals of between 30 and 60 meters. The shafts were equipped with handholds and footholds to help those climbing in and out of them and were covered with a wooden or stone lid. To ensure that the shafts were vertical, Romans hung a plumb line from a rod placed across the top of each shaft and made sure that the weight at the end of it hung in the center of the shaft. Plumb lines were also used to measure the depth of the shaft and to determine the slope of the tunnel. The 5.6-kilometer-long Claudius tunnel, built in 41 CE to drain the Fucine Lake in central Italy, had shafts that were up to 122 meters deep, took 11 years to build and involved approximately 30,000 workers.</div><div><br></div><div>By the 6th century BCE, a second method of tunnel construction appeared called the counter-excavation method, in which the tunnel was constructed from both ends. It was used to cut through high mountains when the qanat method was not a practical alternative. This method required greater planning and advanced knowledge of surveying, mathematics and geometry as both ends of a tunnel had to meet correctly at the center of the mountain. Adjustments to the direction of the tunnel also had to be made whenever builders encountered geological problems or when it deviated from its set path. They constantly checked the tunnel&#8217;s advancing direction, for example, by looking back at the light that penetrated through the tunnel mouth, and made corrections whenever necessary. Large deviations could happen, and they could result in one end of the tunnel not being usable. An inscription written on the side of a 428-meter tunnel, built by the Romans as part of the Saldae aqueduct system in modern-day Algeria, describes how the two teams of builders missed each other in the mountain and how the later construction of a lateral link between both corridors corrected the initial error.</div><div><br></div><div>The Romans dug tunnels for their roads using the counter-excavation method, whenever they encountered obstacles such as hills or mountains that were too high for roads to pass over. An example is the 37-meter-long, 6-meter-high, Furlo Pass Tunnel built in Italy in 69-79 CE. Remarkably, a modern road still uses this tunnel today. Tunnels were also built for mineral extraction. Miners would locate a mineral vein and then pursue it with shafts and tunnels underground. Traces of such tunnels used to mine gold can still be found at the Dolaucothi mines in Wales. When the sole purpose of a tunnel was mineral extraction, construction required less planning, as the tunnel route was determined by the mineral vein.</div><div><br></div><div>Roman tunnel projects were carefully planned and carried out. The length of time it took to construct a tunnel depended on the method being used and the type of rock being excavated. The qanat construction method was usually faster than the counter-excavation method as it was more straightforward. This was because the mountain could be excavated not only from the tunnel mouths but also from shafts. The type of rock could also influence construction times. When the rock was hard, the Romans employed a technique called fire quenching which consisted of heating the rock with fire, and then suddenly cooling it with cold water so that it would crack. Progress through hard rock could be very slow, and it was not uncommon for tunnels to take years, if not decades, to be built. Construction marks left on a Roman tunnel in Bologna show that the rate of advance through solid rock was 30 centimeters per day. In contrast, the rate of advance of the Claudius tunnel can be calculated at 1.4 meters per day. Most tunnels had inscriptions showing the names of patrons who ordered construction and sometimes the name of the architect. For example, the 1.4-kilometer &#199;evlik tunnel in Turkey, built to divert the floodwater threatening the harbor of the ancient city of Seleuceia Pieria, had inscriptions on the entrance, still visible today, that also indicate that the tunnel was started in 69 CE and was completed in 81 CE.</div><div><br></div>",

The iPad is the new pacifier for babies and toddlers. Younger school-aged children read stories on smartphones; older kids don&#8217;t read at all, but hunch over video games. Parents and other passengers read on tablets or skim a flotilla of email and news feeds. Unbeknown to most of us, an invisible, game-changing transformation links everyone in this picture: the neuronal circuit that underlies the brain&#8217;s ability to read is subtly, rapidly changing and this has implications for everyone from the pre-reading toddler to the expert adult.</div><div><br></div><div>As work in neurosciences indicates, the acquisition of literacy necessitated a new circuit in our species&#8217; brain more than 6,000 years ago. That circuit evolved from a very simple mechanism for decoding basic information, like the number of goats in one&#8217;s herd, to the present, highly elaborated reading brain. My research depicts how the present reading brain enables the development of some of our most important intellectual and affective processes: internalized knowledge, analogical reasoning, and inference; perspective-taking and empathy; critical analysis and the generation of insight. Research surfacing in many parts of the world now cautions that each of these essential &#8216;deep reading&#8217; processes may be under threat as we move into digital-based modes of reading.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not a simple, binary issue of print versus digital reading and technological innovations. As MIT scholar Sherry Turkle has written, we do not err as a society when we innovate but when we ignore what we disrupt or diminish while innovating. In this hinge moment between print and digital cultures, society needs to confront what is diminishing in the expert reading circuit, what our children and older students are not developing, and what we can do about it.</div><div><br></div><div>We know from research that the reading circuit is not given to human beings through a genetic blueprint like vision or language; it needs an environment to develop. Further, it will adapt to that environment&#8217;s requirements &#8211; from different writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used. If the dominant medium advantages processes that are fast, multi-task oriented and well-suited for large volumes of information, like the current digital medium, so will the reading circuit. As UCLA psychologist Patricia Greenfield writes, the result is that less attention and time will be allocated to slower, time-demanding deep reading processes.</div><div><br></div><div>Increasing reports from educators and from researchers in psychology and the humanities bear this out. English literature scholar and teacher Mark Edmundson describes how many college students actively avoid the classic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries in favour of something simpler as they no longer have the patience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts. We should be less concerned with students&#8217; &#8216;cognitive impatience&#8217;, however, than by what may underlie it: the potential inability of large numbers of students to read with a level of critical analysis sufficient to comprehend the complexity of thought and argument found in more demanding texts.</div><div><br></div><div>Multiple studies show that digital screen use may be causing a variety of troubling downstream effects on reading comprehension in older high school and college students. In Stavanger, Norway, psychologist Anne Mangen and colleagues studied how high school students comprehend the same material in different mediums. Mangen&#8217;s group asked subjects questions about a short story whose plot had universal student appeal; half of the students read the story on a tablet, the other half in paperback. Results indicated that students who read on print were superior in their comprehension to screen-reading peers, particularly in their ability to sequence detail and reconstruct the plot in chronological order.</div><div><br></div><div>Ziming Liu from San Jose State University has conducted a series of studies which indicate that the &#8216;new norm&#8217; in reading is skimming, involving word-spotting and browsing through the text. Many readers now use a pattern when reading in which they sample the first line and then word-spot through the rest of the text. When the reading brain skims like this, it reduces time allocated to deep reading processes. In other words, we don&#8217;t have time to grasp complexity, to understand another&#8217;s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to create thoughts of the reader&#8217;s own.</div><div><br></div><div>The possibility that critical analysis, empathy and other deep reading processes could become the unintended &#8216;collateral damage&#8217; of our digital culture is not a straightforward binary issue about print versus digital reading. It is about how we all have begun to read o various mediums and how that changes not only what we read, but also the purposes for which we read. Nor is it only about the young. The subtle atrophy of critical analysis and empathy affects us all equally. It affects our ability to navigate a constant bombardment of information. It incentivizes a retreat to the most familiar stores of unchecked information, which require and receive no analysis, leaving us susceptible to false information and irrational ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>There&#8217;s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or lose it. It is a very hopeful principle when applied to critical thought in the reading brain because it implies choice. The story of the changing reading brain is hardly finished. We possess both the science and the technology to identify and redress the changes in how we read before they become entrenched. If we work to understand exactly what we will lose, alongside the extraordinary new capacities that the digital world has brought us, there is as much reason for excitement as caution.</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<div><b>Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A.</b></div><div>Artificial intelligence (AI) can already predict the future. Police forces are using it to map when and where crime is likely to occur. Doctors can use it to predict when a patient is most likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Researchers are even trying to give AI imagination so it can plan for unexpected consequences.</div><div><br></div><div>Many decisions in our lives require a good forecast, and AI is almost always better at forecasting than we are. Yet for all these technological advances, we still seem to deeply lack confidence in AI predictions. Recent cases show that people don&#8217;t like relying on AI and prefer to trust human experts, even if these experts are wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>If we want AI to really benefit people, we need to find a way to get people to trust it. To do that, we need to understand why people are so reluctant to trust AI in the first place.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b></div><div>Take the case of Watson for Oncology, one of technology giant IBM&#8217;s supercomputer programs. Their attempt to promote this program to cancer doctors was a PR disaster. The AI promised to deliver top-quality recommendations on the treatment of 12 cancers that accounted for 80% of the world&#8217;s cases. But when doctors first interacted with Watson, they found themselves in a rather difficult situation. On the one hand, if Watson provided guidance about a treatment that coincided with their own opinions, physicians did not see much point in Watson&#8217;s recommendations. The supercomputer was simply telling them what they already knew, and these recommendations did not change the actual treatment.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, if Watson generated a recommendation that contradicted the experts&#8217; opinion, doctors would typically conclude that Watson wasn&#8217;t competent. And the machine wouldn&#8217;t be able to explain why its treatment was plausible because its machine-learning algorithms were simply too complex to be fully understood by humans. Consequently, this has caused even more suspicion and disbelief, leading many doctors to ignore the seemingly outlandish AI recommendations and stick to their own expertise.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.</b></div><div>This is just one example of people&#8217;s lack of confidence in AI and their reluctance to accept what AI has to offer. Trust in other people is often based on our understanding of how others think and having experience of their reliability. This helps create a psychological feeling of safety. AI, on the other hand, is still fairly new and unfamiliar to most people. Even if it can be technically explained (and that&#8217;s not always the case), AI&#8217;s decision-making process is usually too difficult for most people to comprehend. And interacting with something we don&#8217;t understand can cause anxiety and give us a sense that we&#8217;re losing control.</div><div><br></div><div>Many people are also simply not familiar with many instances of AI actually working, because it often happens in the background. Instead, they are acutely aware of instances where AI goes wrong. Embarrassing AI failures receive a disproportionate amount of media attention, emphasising the message that we cannot rely on technology. Machine learning is not foolproof, in part because the humans who design it aren&#8217;t.</div><div><br></div><div>Feelings about AI run deep. In a recent experiment, people from a range of backgrounds were given various sci-fi films about AI to watch and then asked questions about automation in everyday life. It was found that, regardless of whether the film they watched depicted AI in a positive or negative light, simply watching a cinematic vision of our technological future polarised the participants&#8217; attitudes. Optimists became more extreme in their enthusiasm for AI and sceptics became even more guarded.</div><div><br></div><div>This suggests people use relevant evidence about AI in a biased manner to support their existing attitudes, a deep-rooted human tendency known as &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221;. As AI is represented more and more in media and entertainment, it could lead to a society split between those who benefit from AI and those who reject it. More pertinently, refusing to accept the advantages offered by AI could place a large group of people at a serious disadvantage.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b></div><div>Fortunately, we already have some ideas about how to improve trust in AI. Simply having previous experience with AI can significantly improve people&#8217;s opinions about the technology, as was found in the study mentioned above. Evidence also suggests the more you use other technologies such as the internet, the more you trust them.</div><div><br></div><div>Another solution may be to reveal more about the algorithms which AI uses and the purposes they serve. Several high-profile social media companies and online marketplaces already release transparency reports about government requests and surveillance disclosures. A similar practice for AI could help people have a better understanding of the way algorithmic decisions are made.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b></div><div>Research suggests that allowing people some control over AI decision-making could also improve trust and enable AI to learn from human experience. For example, one study showed that when people were allowed the freedom to slightly modify an algorithm, they felt more satisfied with its decisions, more likely to believe it was superior and more likely to use it in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>We don&#8217;t need to understand the intricate inner workings of AI systems, but if people are given a degree of responsibility for how they are implemented, they will be more willing to accept AI into their lives.</div><div><br></div>",

        "content": "<b>Bricks - The Versatile Building Material</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Bricks are one of the oldest known building materials dating back to 7000 BCE. The oldest found were sun-dried mud bricks in southern Turkey and these would have been standard in those days. Although sun-dried mud bricks worked reasonably well, especially in moderate climates, fired bricks were found to be more resistant to harsher weather conditions and so fired bricks are much more reliable for use in permanent buildings. Fired brick are also useful in hotter climates, as they can absorb any heat generated throughout the day and then release it at night.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The Romans also distinguished between the bricks they used that were dried by the sun and air and the bricks that were fired in a kiln. The Romans were real brick connoisseurs. They preferred to make their bricks in the spring and hold on to their bricks for two years, before they were used or sold. They only used clay that was whitish or red for their bricks. The Romans passed on their skills around their sphere of influence and were especially successful at using their mobile kilns to introduce kiln-fired bricks to the whole of the Roman Empire.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>During the twelfth century, bricks were introduced to northern Germany from northern Italy. This created the &#8216;brick Gothic period,&#8217; which was a reduced style of Gothic architecture previously very common in northern Europe. The buildings around this time were mainly built from fired red clay bricks. The brick Gothic period can be categorised by the lack of figural architectural sculptures that had previously been carved in stone, as the Gothic figures were impossible to create out of bulky bricks at that time.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Bricks suffered a setback during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, with exposed brick walls becoming unpopular and brickwork being generally covered by plaster. Only during the mid eighteenth century did visible brick walls again regain some popularity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Bricks today are more commonly used in the construction of buildings than any other material, except wood. Brick architecture is dominant within its field and a great industry has developed and invested in the manufacture of many different types of bricks of all shapes and colours. With modern machinery, earth moving equipment, powerful electric motors and modern tunnel kilns, making bricks has become much more productive and efficient. Bricks can be made from a variety of materials, the most common being clay, but they can also be made of calcium silicate and concrete.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Good quality bricks have major advantages over stone as they are reliable, weather resistant and can tolerate acids, pollution and fire. They are also much cheaper than cut stonework. Bricks can be made to any specification in colour, size and shape, which makes them easier to build with than stone. On the other hand, there are some bricks that are more porous and therefore more susceptible to damage from dampness when exposed to water. For best results in any construction work, the correct brick must be chosen in accordance with the job specifications.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today, bricks are mainly manufactured in factories, usually employing one of three principal methods - the soft mud process, the stiff mud process and the dry clay process. In the past, bricks were largely manufactured by hand, and there are still artisanal companies that specialise in this product. The process involves putting the clay, water and additives into a large pit, where it is all mixed together by a tempering wheel, often still moved by horse power. Once the mixture is of the correct consistency, the clay is removed and pressed into moulds by hand. To prevent the brick from sticking to the mould, the brick is coated in either sand or water, though coating a brick with sand gives an overall better finish to it. Once shaped, the bricks are laid outside to dry by air and sun for three to four days. If these bricks left outside for the drying process are exposed to a shower, the water can leave indentations on the brick, which, although not affecting the strength of the brick, is considered very undesirable. After drying, the bricks are then transferred to the kiln for firing and this creates the finished product. Bricks are now more generally made by manufacturing processes using machinery. This is a large-scale effort and produces bricks that have been fired in patent kilns.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today&#8217;s bricks are also specially designed to be efficient at insulation. If their composition is correct and their laying accurate, a good brick wall around a house can save the occupants a significant amount of money. This is primarily achieved today through cavity wall insulation. Insulating bricks are built in two separate leaves, as they are called in the trade. The gap between the inner and outer leaves of brickwork depends on the type of insulation used, but there should be enough space for a gap of twenty millimetres between the insulating material in the cavity and the two leaves on either side. The air in these gaps is an efficient insulator by itself. Cavity walls have also replaced solid walls, because they are more resistant to rain penetration. Because two leaves are necessary, a strong brick manufacturing industry is essential, so that enough good quality insulating bricks are plentifully available.<br></div>",

        "content": "<b>The Rise of Agri tourism</b><div><br></div><div>In advanced industrialised countries, small farmers have been challenged by changing economic and social conditions, such as increased global competition, falling commodity prices, and capital- and technology-intensive agricultural production. In addition, there has been added public pressure to make expensive changes in farming methods, due to public environmental concerns about industrialised agricultural production in combination with political pressures to reduce agricultural subsidies. These changing economic and social conditions have disproportionately impacted smaller farms in Europe and the US.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Agritourism is becoming an increasingly popular way for rural property owners to earn additional income from agricultural properties. In addition to more traditional farm tours and seasonal activities, such as hay rides, corn mazes and u-pick fruits, farm owners are devising new ways to bring people to their door by offering more entertainment-oriented activities. Some farmers are offering their barns as venues for weddings, parties, dances and other special events. Others are opening their homes to visitors for vacations, so guests can experience life on a working farm by helping out with routine farm chores, such as feeding or herding the livestock, milking the animals, making cheese, collecting eggs, picking vegetables and preparing farm fresh meals. Agritourism works in combination with a growing public desire to engage in rural experiences and outdoor recreational activities. By combining agriculture and tourism, agritourism offers these rural experiences to urban residents and economic diversification to farmers.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Part of the attraction of agritourism is the nostalgia it creates for a simpler time and its authenticity. Tourists are being sold, not only on beautiful sceneries and visual aesthetics, but also experiences that are meant to open up a new world for these customers who are tired of the hustle and bustle of city life. Authenticity has been an abiding theme in tourism studies and it may have a special meaning in this combination of agriculture and tourism. For one thing, the image of the family farm remains imbued with deep authenticity, the surviving representation of an old world ideal. To partake in agritourism is therefore likely to convey the sense of having a deeply authentic experience. Critics have claimed that this desire to reconnect with the life world of one&#8217;s ancestors may conflict with the nature of modern agriculture and whether the tourist will want to face its true realities. It seems therefore that often the most distinctive innovative effort involves the reinvention of tradition and rural tourism products. Examples are the recreation of home- produced products long since replaced by manufactured commodities and the provision of hands-on-experiences in crafts often recreated for tourists. As a result, some critics argue that the tourists who are running to the countryside are over-crowding and ruining the pristine beauty that they so desperately want to experience.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Agritourism can benefit the life and economy of local communities, as well as the farms themselves. Agritourism firstly means that some farms can continue in business and employ workers. Employment underscores the genuine importance of agritourism farms to local economies, as rural communities are usually areas that both have high unemployment and few alternatives for the unemployed to find work. Secondly, a significant number of agritourists come from areas reasonably local to the visited farms. This means that tourist spending on agritourism often stays in the region, helping to generate taxable revenues and more disposable incomes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s agricultural census, taken every five years, found that last year approximately 23,000 farms took part in agritourism. These farms each earned $24,300 from agritourism, compared to five years ago, when farms engaged in this brought in only $7,200 per farm. The trend is clearly growing and the money generated will stimulate local economies. Thirdly, agritourism benefits the local community in terms of education. Many farms offer tours for elementary school-age children, who can learn where their food is coming from and how it is produced.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Farms choosing to develop agritourism have had reasonable government support. Over the last 20 years, European Union countries have spent 2 billion euros to subsidise agritourism development in rural farming areas that cannot compete in a global market with declining commodity prices. This, in turn, helps governments by keeping farmers on land, protecting picturesque rural landscapes that attract tourists, and supporting the production of regional agricultural products. As well as finance, local and national governments should create in the areas under their jurisdiction favourable environments for the development of agritourism, by changing regulatory and tax constraints, so that more farms are encouraged to enter the industry.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is clear that there are strong economic and social benefits that agritourism can provide farmers, customers and the local areas where the farms are situated. Agritourism contributes to and enhances the quality of life in communities by expanding recreational opportunities, differentiating rural economies, and promoting the retention of agricultural lands. Working agricultural landscapes reflect the efforts of generations of farm families and often provide a defining sense of culture, heritage, and rural character. Agritourism provides educational opportunities for school children and adults to learn about this agrarian heritage, the production of food, and resource stewardship. Finally, many agritourism operations provide consumers with direct access to fresh farm goods. Agritourism is an industry with an enormous potential for growth. With it, farming could become more efficient and sustainable, rural areas could become more beautiful and farmers could become better off and more significant employers and contributors to economies.</div>",

        "content": "<b>The Fight Against Polio</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b><br></div><div>The poliovirus is one of the smallest and simplest viruses. It is usually spread by just dirty fingers and in most cases is confined to the gut. As the virus travels down the intestine, it induces the body to produce antibodies against it, which will protect the person against future attacks. In about one per cent of cases, the virus floods into the bloodstream and infects the nerve cells in the spinal cord that drive the muscles. This causes the characteristic paralysis, which can affect one or more limbs and/or the muscles of respiration, in which case artificial ventilation, for example with the iron lung, may be needed to keep the patient breathing and alive. The iron lung, which was officially known as a negative pressure ventilator, was invented hundreds of years ago, but was further developed in the 1930&#8217;s to help with the world polio outbreaks. At one point, the need for iron lungs was so high that they were used with a patient within an hour of their manufacture.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B<br></b></div><div>Polio originally caused sporadic clusters of paralysis, especially in children. For some reason, this pattern changed during the late nineteenth century into explosive epidemics, which swept through many countries each summer. The first major outbreak, on the East Coast of the USA in the summer of 1916, caused 25,000 cases of paralysis and 6,000 deaths. Draconian public health measures were powerless to prevent the spread of the disease, resulting in widespread panic across America. Each year, panic resurfaced as the polio season approached, with the wealthy leaving towns and cities in droves.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b><br></div><div>This fear of polio was deliberately fuelled and exploited by the March of Dimes, an American fund- raising organisation set up by President Franklin D Roosevelt, himself a polio survivor. The March of Dimes raised vast sums, and funded both practical support for polio victims and their families, and the research programmes that ultimately resulted in effective polio vaccines.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D<br></b></div><div>Polio can be prevented but not cured. Treatments proposed for patients with acute polio have included barbaric measures, such as branding the child&#8217;s back with a red-hot poker and &#8216;brain washout therapy&#8217;. Less dramatic were massive doses of vitamins C and chemically modified cobra venom. None of these had any impact on paralysis or survival, and some were positively dangerous. The iron lung could rescue patients from suffocation if their respiratory muscles were paralysed, but the iron lung itself carried considerable risks. Until chest infections could be properly treated, seventy per cent of patients put inside the iron lung died there.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b><br></div><div>Two rival strategies were used to develop vaccines to protect against polio. Jonas Salk (1914&#8211;1998) favoured an &#8216;inactivated polio vaccine&#8217; (IPV), in which wild polioviruses are &#8216;killed&#8217; with formalin, so that they can no longer replicate and spread into the spinal cord. IPV is injected into a muscle and causes protective antibodies to appear in the bloodstream. The &#8216;oral polio vaccine&#8217; (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin (1906&#8211;1993) relies on the fact that polioviruses forced to grow under unfavourable conditions in the laboratory will undergo mutation into forms that can no longer invade the spinal cord. The OPV virus is still &#8216;alive&#8217; and able to replicate, but cannot enter the spinal cord and cause paralysis. OPV is taken by mouth and, like a wild poliovirus, induces immunity against itself in the gut wall as it travels through the intestine. It therefore provides a different type of immunity protection when compared with the Salk vaccine.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b><br></div><div>Salk&#8217;s IPV was the first polio vaccine to be tested on a large scale, in massive clinical trials in 1954 involving 1.8 million American children. Following the sensational declaration that his vaccine &#8216;works and is safe&#8217;, Salk became a national and international hero, and mass vaccination of children with his IPV began immediately. Vaccination continued despite a tragic outbreak of paralytic (and sometimes fatal) polio due to contamination of the Salk vaccine with wild poliovirus, which was the result of carelessness in the vaccine production plant. Numbers of paralytic cases and deaths from polio fell dramatically in the USA over the next few years, and Salk&#8217;s vaccine was taken up across the world. Sabin&#8217;s OPV, being cheaper, more effective and easier to give, later superseded the Salk vaccine. Given correctly, both vaccines protect against polio and are overwhelmingly safe. There is an exceedingly low risk (one in 500,000 vaccinations) of Sabin&#8217;s OPV reverting to a paralysing variant, a drawback that Sabin always refused to acknowledge.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b><br></div><div>Polio vaccine not only protects individuals, but, if given intensively and on a massive scale, can prevent the virus from spreading and so stamp it out. In 1988, various organisations set out to clear the planet of polio through a worldwide vaccination campaign. The hope was that polio would follow the example of smallpox, which was exterminated by intensive global vaccination during the late 1970&#8217;s. Now, after 26 years, polio is tantalisingly close to being eradicated, with just 200 paralytic cases worldwide last year, as compared with over 300,000 in 1988. Tragically, though, endemic polio continues to cling on in three areas, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern Nigeria, largely because of anti-western ideology that is backed up by intimidation, death threats and the murder of many vaccinators and their supporters. Usually refugees, but also other travellers, have reintroduced polio to other countries, for example Syria, Lebanon and various African states, which had been previously cleared of polio. Unfortunately, it is now very unlikely that polio will be eradicated within the next two to three years and it seems that the final extermination of the virus will depend as much on diplomacy as on medicine and science.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Draconian &#8211; severe or harsh.</div><div>In droves &#8211; in large numbers.</div></div>",

Not much can be gleaned from observing recumbent persons and questionnaires are no use, because people remember little of their experience during sleep. The breakthrough came in the 1950&#8217;s with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain electrical activity, when it was confirmed that sleep is anything but dormant.<br></div><div><br></div><div>We need sleep for biological restoration. It promotes cell growth, regeneration and memory consolidation. By shutting down most of the body&#8217;s machinery, resources can be focused on repairing damage and development. When people are deprived of sleep for any reason, there is deterioration in performance, particularly on tasks requiring concentration, and eventually, behaviour becomes shambolic. The individual becomes progressively incoherent and irritable and, after a few days, may experience delusions and hallucinations. The disruptive effects of sleep deprivation have even been successfully used as a basis of persuasion in interrogation.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A vital part of sleep is dreaming, which happens most intensively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We typically spend more than two hours each night dreaming, though this is often spread over four or five separate periods. Infants spend up to 50 per cent of their sleep time in REM sleep, which is understandable when one realises that REM sleep is the time used for brain development, as well as learning, thinking, and organising information. If people are woken when REM sleep commences, depriving them specifically of dream-sleep, the proportion of REM sleep increases once they fall asleep again to make up what was lost. This suggests that REM sleep is an essential aspect of sleep.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sleep and sleep-related problems play a role in a large number of human disorders and affect almost every field of medicine. For example, problems like a stroke tend to occur more frequently during the night and early morning, due to changes in hormones, heart rate, and other characteristics associated with sleep. Sleep also affects some kinds of epilepsy in complex ways. REM sleep seems to help prevent seizures that begin in one part of the brain from spreading to other brain regions, while deep sleep may promote the spread of these seizures. Sleep deprivation can also trigger seizures in people with some types of epilepsy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The neurons that control sleep interact strongly with the immune system. As anyone who has had the flu knows, infectious diseases tend to make people feel sleepy. This probably happens because cytokines, chemicals produced while fighting an infection, are powerful sleep-inducing substances. Sleep helps the body conserve energy that the body&#8217;s immune system needs to mount an attack.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sleeping problems occur in almost all people with mental disorders, including those with depression and schizophrenia. People with depression, for example, often awaken in the early hours of the morning and find themselves unable to get back to sleep. The amount of sleep a person gets also strongly influences the symptoms of mental disorders. Sleep deprivation is an effective therapy for people with certain types of depression, while it can actually cause depression in other people. Extreme sleep deprivation can lead to a seemingly psychotic state of paranoia and hallucinations in otherwise healthy people, and disrupted sleep can trigger episodes of mania in people with manic depression.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sleeping problems are common in many other disorders as well, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, stroke, cancer, and head injury. These sleeping problems may arise from changes in the brain regions and neurotransmitters that control sleep, or from the drugs used to control symptoms of other disorders. In patients who are hospitalised or who receive round-the-clock care, treatment schedules or hospital routines also may disrupt sleep. The old joke about a patient being awakened by a nurse so he could take a sleeping pill contains a grain of truth. Once sleeping problems develop, they can add to a person&#8217;s impairment and cause confusion, frustration, or depression. Patients who are unable to sleep also notice pain more and may increase their requests for pain medication. Better management of sleeping problems in people who have a variety of disorders could improve the health of these patients and their quality of life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Insomnia is a widespread affliction. It is linked with conditions such as depression and chronic pain, but occurs also in otherwise healthy people. It is often due to temporary life circumstances, like trouble at work or anticipation of an exciting event, however, some people just have difficulty sleeping regardless of circumstances. What is interesting is that complaints of sleeplessness are often exaggerated, because people remember more easily the times they are awake during the night than the times they are asleep. When insomniacs are observed in a sleep lab, their EEG records often suggest that their sleep pattern is fairly normal, even though in the morning they maintain they hardly slept a wink. Various devices for monitoring one&#8217;s own sleep patterns are now marketed, for example mobile phone apps connected with forehead electrodes.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The fact that a third of our life is spent in sleep would, in itself, be sufficient justification for studying it scientifically. The discovery that it is not just a passive state, but a highly active process of profound biological and psychological importance, has led to great efforts in recent decades to further our understanding of it. Despite that, we are far from unravelling all of sleep&#8217;s mysteries.<br></div>",

Stars remain fixed in the pattern of their constellations, and are regular in their motion through the sky from one night to the next, and from one month to the next. A planet follows a fairly slow but expected path. By comparison, a comet is a totally different kind of event: it will appear unexpectedly and at any place in the sky, it will change position from one night to the next relative to the background of stars, and its path will be along a separate direction and path across the sky from the planets and stars. During the few weeks or months that it is observable, it will first steadily increase in brightness from one night to the next, may change its shape &#8211; growing bigger, longer or extra tails &#8211; and then wane to invisibility, never to be seen again. Throughout history, comets have always signified evil, war and death, and they were supposed to leave chaos and calamity in their wake. Indeed, plenty of past comets have been blamed by the astrologers of their day for bringing or marking misfortune.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There have been many spectacular comets throughout history; on average we are visited by what is termed a &#8216;great comet&#8217; about three times a century. This appellation is saved for those comets that reach exceptional brightness. The most famous of all comets is Halley&#8217;s comet; not that it is the most spectacular, but study of its orbit by the English astronomer, Edmond Halley, was fundamental to pinning down the real nature of comets. During the 17th century, Halley was using Newton&#8217;s new mathematics of calculus to try to characterise the orbits of twenty-four comets from sightings recorded over the previous four centuries. He realised that the orbital path of the bright comet recently seen in 1682 was very similar to that followed by two other comets &#8211; one observed in 1531 and one in 1607. All moved in a retrograde direction (i.e. opposite to the revolution of the planets round the Sun), following an elliptical orbit that had a similar orientation to the plane of the planets&#8217; motion. The great comet of 1456 was also known to have travelled in a retrograde direction. Halley&#8217;s inspiration was to realise that these were four apparitions of the same comet, following a set path around the Sun, but which only became apparent to observers on Earth when its orbit returned the comet to the inner Solar System, after an interval of about 76 years. Although he did not live to see the success of his prediction of the comet&#8217;s return in 1758, when the comet was spotted on schedule, it was given his name. Subsequently, at least 23 previous appearances of Halley&#8217;s comet have been identified from historical records, the first known being from a Chinese text dating from 240BC.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The nucleus is the sole solid component of a comet, and the only part that is always present. It resembles a dark-coloured iceberg; it is a frozen chunk of ice ranging between 5 to 20 km in size, and with a somewhat irregular shape. The ice is not just water ice, but also contains the ices of frozen ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide. The ices are blackened, as they contain small fragments of dust embedded within them, and the whole nucleus is of a low density, suggesting it to be a partially porous body. When travelling along the outer reaches of its orbit, far from the Sun, the nucleus remains frozen and dormant. As soon as its path brings the icy block into the inner Solar system, it begins to warm up and its surface becomes active. The solid ice turns directly into gas, in a process known as &#8216;sublimation,&#8217; and is liberated from the surface. The process is particularly apparent on the sunward flank of the nucleus, where the gases escape as jets, particularly through any fissures that open up in the structure. These jets also push out the particles of solid dust that are embedded in the ice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The closer an orbit brings a nucleus to the Sun, the warmer it becomes, and the more spectacular tails are generated with them, sometimes being visible during the day. There are two types of comet tails: dust and gas ion. A dust tail contains small, solid particles that are about the same size as those found in cigarette smoke. This tail forms because sunlight pushes on these small particles, gently shoving them away from the comet&#8217;s nucleus. Because the pressure from sunlight is relatively weak, the dust particles end up forming a diffuse curved tail in the direction of the comet&#8217;s orbit. A gas ion tail forms when ultraviolet sunlight rips one or more electrons from gas atoms in the coma, making them into ions. The solar wind then carries these ions straight outward away from the Sun. As a comet heads away from the Sun, its tails dissipate, and the matter contained in its nucleus freezes into a rock-like material.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Constellation &#8211; a recognised pattern of bodies in the sky.</div><div>Elliptical &#8211; oval-shaped.</div><div>Sublimation - the change of a substance from solid to gas without an intermediate liquid stage.</div></div>",

Until the 1990&#8217;s, most of this recovery has occurred from conventional wells that were drilled down to rock formations, from which hydrocarbons could be pumped to the surface. The discovery of hydraulic fracking in the late 1940&#8217;s has long allowed companies to extract gas and oil from shale, but the perfection of these two techniques over the past few decades has allowed the process to become cost effective. There are numerous shale plays in the United States from which shale gas can be extracted, and firms are busy drilling wells in many areas of the country.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B&#160;</b></div><div><span>Shale gas is natural methane in rock formations deep underground that, before fracking, was not feasible to extract. Its removal today depends on hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the use of pressure to force liquids containing proppants (often sand) into rock strata, so that hydrocarbons are available for extraction. Current technology uses water, sand, and miscellaneous fluids, all of which must be imported to the well site. A wellbore is drilled, and then the fracturing fluid is forced through holes in the casing into the plays. High pressures are used to create fissures where the proppants are deposited to hold fissures open, so that hydrocarbons can be released. Hydraulic fracturing occurs in a number of stages and the fracturing fluid is forced into a small portion of the wellbore at each stage. After the hydraulic fracturing is completed, some of the fracturing fluid comes back up the well. Because the flowback and wastewater from a well can be toxic, it must be disposed of in a manner that does not create any health, safety, or environmental problems. The underground areas from which the gas is extracted may be left with cavities, which in turn can sometimes cause ground subsidence.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph C&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>The development of American shale gas deposits has been accompanied by notable benefits and a significant impact on the American economy. Next year, it is estimated that the development of America&#8217;s shale gas resources will employ 869,000 people. The shale gas industry will have capital expenditures of $48 billion and pay more than $28 billion in federal and state taxes this year. Due to shale gas, the US is using less coal and the country&#8217;s electricity costs have been lowered by about ten per cent. Shale gas has also contributed to a decrease in imports of foreign natural gas.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph D&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Yet not everything is positive. The development of shale gas resources is associated with its toxic pollutants and environmental problems. It needs to be mentioned that the American federal and state governments were not prepared for the problems that accompany shale gas development. A lack of sufficient regulatory oversight in the US when the industry began allowed some unfortunate situations and instances of damage that could have been prevented.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph E&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Sites where wells are drilled for extracting shale gas often cover about two hectares and involve increased traffic, noise, light, dangerous equipment, and toxic chemicals. The activities and conditions at a site therefore create a potential for contamination and environmental degradation. The major risk involves damage from the toxic chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The fracking fluid is approximately 99.5 per cent water and sand and 0.5 per cent additives used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery. An average of 5000 gallons of chemical additives may be used to frack a well and some of them are toxic. Since different chemicals and different amounts are used at each well, the toxicities may vary.</span><br></span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F&#160;&#160;</b></div><div><span>Under US federal law, the chemicals used at a well are exempted from full reporting requirements. Under most state laws, the supplier or the service company of a fracturing operation must disclose information, unless the chemicals are claimed as a trade secret. Recently, it was estimated that in approximately two-thirds of the cases the complete chemical compositions were not reported. Chemical secrecy is a problem, because persons working at wells and persons who come into contact with chemicals used at a well do not have sufficient information to know whether they need medical attention. Without timely information of the chemicals involved in a spill or release, first responders to emergencies, health professionals, and property owners may lack key information for deciding what actions they should take.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph G</b></span></span></div><div><span>&#160;Issues are also being raised about the need for better management practices to reduce the risks that accompany shale gas development. Hundreds of best management practices have been identified to employ during energy development and extraction, but most of these are currently voluntary. In the absence of mandatory management practices covering all of the stages of shale gas development, there are not sufficient assurances that people and the environment are adequately protected against health and safety problems. By adopting more mandatory management practices, the industry may be able to reduce the risks and shale gas development would be beneficial overall.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph H&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>The American experiences can be helpful in discerning whether other countries might proceed with shale gas development. The activities connected with developing shale gas can be assessed to learn about the risks, dangers, and problems that need to be addressed. Then, existing laws and regulations can be evaluated to determine their probable success in addressing the risks. Additional regulations can be developed if they are needed and firms can be required to adopt best management practices. Governments can require disclosure of dangerous materials and establish funding mechanisms to pay for regulatory oversight and for collecting monies to be used to remedy future damages caused by fracking.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Shale play &#8211; An underground formation of a type of rock containing natural gas.</div><div>Proppant &#8211; A solid material used in fracking to keep holes open during the fracking process.</div></span></div>",
